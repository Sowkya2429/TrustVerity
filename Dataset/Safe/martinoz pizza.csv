Payment failed on any method. Tried severl times
The food was delicious.i have given some special instructions for the pizza base and it was fullfill by your team nicely.For door step delivery services it was a decent experience for me. The Delivery boy's nature is So good. They delivered food on time and gave me Delight service. Overall it was a great Experience for me to choose the Martino'z in this competitive market.will choose again in future for further hunger.
Very bad experience they provide us very late delivery because of which food does not remain hot
I just say thank you and your service is the best and you food has amazing quality and I am fan of you
Very bad service

Great payment mode
Working faster than other apps

Very bad service don't give online order no one is pick up the phone from store
Yesterday I ordered 4 pizzas in BOGO varieties and it turned out to be 1 hour late order. The delivery boy couldn't find the address by the GPS. Also the pizzas were in worst condition. When I called to the main outlet they were not sorry at all for the delay in service and told us to just cancel the order. They were so rude in the way of talking.

"Note: App only accept debit card payment, pls fix payment gateway issues"
Quality was very bad
Best pizza quality and ingredients Awesome taste 😋
Very poor quality of food.. Also updating status of orders are also poor
Poor And pathetic packing And carry bag chargeable 25/- RS....
👍Fast delivery
World's most bakwass pizza i have ever had.. Even road side pizza could be better then this.. total waste of money.. Worst taste Guys dont get fooled by their promotion
Good and fast delivery
बहोत ही बकवास है आपका सर्विस और खास कर गार्लिक ब्रेड बहोत ही बकवास आज तक ऐसी बकवास नही खाया
"Best pizzeria in town, with loads of cheeze and the best pizza is Cheezy 9 is the yummiest one I love the most❤❤❤❤Do visit Martinoz Pizzaaaaaaaaaaa and have a delicious Food"
Not giving dilivery so what is the purpose of this app.?
Had a good experience but payment deduction issue facing. Kindly request you to please check it with payment gateway.
Just done order and no any option for cancellation and I call to surat adajan outlet in under one minute for cancel order and he said all order are ready So how it's possible
Very nice and yummy pizza. At martinoz bilimora
Very very bed sarvish not for test wet of mony
Poor customer service and very irresponsible answer from outlet.
Pizza 🍕 is good and test waise very good but 9 chize 🍕 is 🫡
Best pizza
"Today for the first time ordered Martinoz's Jain Pizza via app, Very bad customer experience and Did not like the Pizza, got delivery in 40 mins and by that time Pizza was cold, Base was not fresh, Even did not like the taste..."
Very Good taste for martinoz pizza
Worst quality
very poor delivery service
"I bought large pizzas but I think they stretched pizza size medium to large..,very thin in center according to other pizza brands, but overall taste was good"
Why can't they delivery to any address in Ahmedabad??????
Customer request ki value nai hai i request genuenly to plz do not add mashrum on pizza but they decline my request and my pizza and money get waste worst service
It was very bad the taste was not good at all. I would like it to be refunded it was that bad
Delicious food and timely delivery.... Better than lapinoz and other pizza outlets ......
"your staff is such a careless about your customers, especially who order you by your app they don't want to inform your clients about discount and other benefits and they must know your clients to how you order for get more benefits they are not looking far such shamless martino's pizza so this message i will forward to my all groups please do not order pizza to Martino's and you guys talking about hospitality ? your staff they know what is the meaning of hospitality specially here in rajkot🖕👎"
Not happy with the Delivery guy...there was lift available but he didn't came for delivery at door step and instead he asked me to came over for pickup
I love martinoz pizza
"App is slow in processing payment, had to do multiple attempts, got debited twice & received double order :( No call from Martinoz to verify same order, same person, same address."
It's very expensive and also charge 25rs for carry bag which is even too much expensive hopefully this brand have to low their prize or close the brand
FoR Martino'Z (Gota Outlet)... NicE QualitY👍 VerietY PizZzaaaaS TestY For All ToungS 👅... MusT TrY AtleasT OncE☝️... Then 🤔 ThinK FoR NexT....
Cash on delivery method rakhne ki jaroorat hai aapko please focus on it.
Application was very user friendly. But food wasn't.
Good service good food
The food was very delicious!! All our children liked it....birthday went super tasty and special by adding your lava cake at last...thanks aa lotttt!!!
Frozen thing
"By far the worst pizza ever. I don't critize food but when you are paying same amount as other pizza franchise, martinoz pizza quality is not good. I added 9 cheese option and the cook didn't have a clue so they just messed up my pizza. My whole family was disappointed from the food itself. the cook should try Drizzle's, La pinoz pizzas."
Really pizza was not cooked properly... Worst delivery experience. Not good at all...
Pizza & pasta is very testy any other brand nice 👌👌🥳
Cheese white sauce pasta and pizza is very nice testy Pizza and pasta I love it pasta and pizza my favorite😍 😍😘😘😚😋😋😋
Chesse white sauce pasta and pizza is very nice 😊😊😊❣️❣️❣️ I love it pizza and pasta 😋😋😋🍝😋
They need to work on Pizza Base. It need improvement.
Awesome food.... tummy full.... Happy heart.....🤗🤗😊
Very bad quality. Not delivery time limit. Its delevery time is 1 to 1.30 hours
Really Very Good quality at New outlet of Junagadh
Very SLOW delivery.. The COLDEST pizza I ever ate in delivery..😞😞 Taste is good but no use if it's not hot... Aatlooo thando pizza hoto hot Bhai😒🙄... Dhandho Naa karvo toh bandh kar do.. bhaav unchaa naaam motaaa n service 😏🤢.... Guys confirm twice before ordering...🙄🙄
"Very bad food, expired chees, no delivery facility,"
Bad interphase n poor customer service
Pizza is so good but delivering is not good
Ok
Excellent
Good app
Delicious taste....👍
Too late delivery of food
Worst service... waiting for food for last 2 hours but still my order not received
Very poor service
Very late delevery
Good taste.....good service
Excellent app 👍
loda jeva pizza hata akdum chitya jeva ava pizza hoy paysa ne to ma choday gay
Not delivery at my home i am so angry for this
"Took an 2 hours to get food. Food was tasteless and not cooked well and my sister found dead insect in her food. It was a busy night I get it, but worst service I have ever experienced. SWITCH to Another pizza brand I recommend."
Need to prove app and pizaa and they forced to install app for buy pizza Becoz nobody want to install and that's the not good service and pizza
Very nice app and service..
Plz allow payment method cash on bogo😞On the other hand the pizzas are really delicious with great quality🤤💯💯
Very good app for pizza orders.
Poor home deliver service
payment has been cancelled then accept order i order same time not recieved my money back when i cancel one order
Worst customer care support and worst pizza. Outlets are arrogant and if you complain nobody is there to resolve. Even they mark deliver before delivery. Waste of money and time. Please don't go or place order from Martino'z.
The badest place where you cannot order below ₹249 you have to order above ₹249 and tax is not included your minimum buget is ₹249 and without tax.
Hopeless Service i will give a zero star
TODAY I ORDERED PIZZA DOUBLE CHEESE MARGRETA AND IN THE PIZZA THE CHEESE WAS VERY BAD THE BASE WAS LIKE PLATES THE CHEESE WAS LIKE PAPAD. NOW I WILL NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM MARTINOZ AND THE PIZZA IS VERY COLD
Taste was not good at all. Not worth money. Not going to buy next time
"Worst experience. Initially Quality is good, but after then worst Quality. Never ever give pick up order or delivery."
What a taste yaarr pizza lover
Bred is very hard
Bad hospitability.
Good food
Worst pizza ever I get...very bad quality nd get different pizza from my ordered pizza and cold pizza served ....never go to this place...
"I have visited Martinoz Gota branch. Pizza's are awesome specially 9 cheez, a must try. Awesome choco Lava cake topped with roasted almonds...superb. Ambiance is no nice with very good sitting arrangement for dine in. owner is very friendly and paid special attention on order personally. Very good staff"
Very bad pizza
Wrost delivery service Wrost customer care service
Very bad food 😞
"Nerver order pizza from this place,inspite of apologize for too late delivery,they told me to adjust.so i have to pay around 600 bucks for adjust?! I ordered at sharp 8.30 p.m and they deliver me at 10.45 p.m.,and delivery boy was so dumb that after give him proper location and guide of address though he can't find,then i have to walk about 750 meter far from society so that he can find me,i was infront of him and also shout that here i am,though that dumb guy passed me 4 times and didn't hear."
"Bekar pizaaa totaly 😖 size is olso small not a testy i vest of money, everyone carefully"
Value for Money
Loved it
Best food 😋
"Pizza was good and tasty but it took 2hrs to deliver, very poor delivery services"
Worst experience.... never ever going to order plus their staff has no IQ the way they are behaving with customers just hate this restaurant...
Very bed pizza Pizza baze is very hard
Very bed 😡🤬
Absolutely delicious and a super cute handwritten note. I was initially not going to leave a review but the time taken is deeply appreciated.
So delicious 😋
Very bed Veshu outlets is very bed food quality...bed behaviour with customer
One plus one ullu banavava ni skim chhe. 1+1 ma Quality bear aape chhe.
Love your food
"#Martinoz(Gota), Brand itself is just great. Talking about this branch the staff , quality of food, and most importantly the speed of service is just GREAT!"
Should never try at this outlet. They serve burnt pizza and had a very bad aroma in ingredients.
Received Cold Pizza too much time taken for home delevery even Pizza center is Near by my Home Need to improve Home delevery service
I ordered online and my food is ready but 10 minute are passed from the food is ready message and they didn't even got a delivery boy to deliver my food (first and last order) Update : 20 minutes they still didnt find any delivery boy
Don't ever place order from this official Website as they are very Lasy in delivery.
I got a pizza delivered after 1 hour...n that was cold too..
Good
Worst taste.... Waste of money....Eat from la pinoz instead
superb delcies pizza
The app isn't updating in my phone
App not opening easily
Dominos is best.....baki sab bakwaas
Super tasty pizza 🍕 and lots of options to try and the have best type of bass bread . love IT 😍🤤😍🤤😊
Good
Very poor home delivery service.
☺️
Martinoz pizza app ko mat karna download because order karne ke baad bhi nai aata pizza
Home delivery of food is very poor and app doesn't show updated of current status.
"From Surat, Katargam I have ordered pizza from Martinoz, they delivered me cold pizza at my place which can not etable, wrost ever service i have seen. Specialy Surat, Katargam branch."
Good
Delicious food
Delivery Not available in my area
Quality was not good
Delivery samay sar nathi thati ane coupon nathi hoti jevi k dominos jevi.... Ane pizza thanda hoy 6 ane base 1 dam black hoy 6
"Third class pizza in the world No cheese in wild garlic pizza, only onion Schezwan sauce 9 cheese pizza have only 3 type of cheese and Schezwan sauce. Lapinoz and Lamilano are best."
Very bad experience with the app......Didn't even received my pizza even though it says pizza has been dilevered. On calling the shop no one answers. Recommend not buying pizza through this app
Pizzas are good but oregano and chilli flax are not delivered 🙄👎🏻
"Good app but no coupan codes,will give 5 star if you add coupan codes similar like la'pinoz and la milano pizzeria. 😔"
Delivery not on time very late
Waste of money. I have ordered 9 cheese but it seems there is only one cheese with very thin layer.
Nice axperince nd service too
"Hopeless Pizza , I have ever had. Never try this if you are new customer for this store. Your money will be totally waste"
Disappointed
"Very bed test and all stuff, They dont know about how to deliver pizza."
Very bad pizza bais.
Good quality
Very nice quality love this very good
Very very delicious 🍕
Yummy pizza
The pizza's are amazing but need to work on the delivery i received my pizza after more than 1 hour 30 minutes this is not acceptable else the taste was great better if I received earlier
it is a nice app
Pathetic pizza given. Might 1 day old pizza given. Also time for take out is more than Zomato orders. I order at 7:15Pm and my order was ready on 8:25pm tho 4 Zomato order was delivered in that period.😑
It will take more time in pikout in current location The pizza goes cold
Not so good pizza..... And delivery is very late and pizza is cold...😡
pizza was good. it's cheesy and taste is soo delicious 👍 just to improve tracker system for home delivery.
yumm pizzuu
Very bad quality pizza.
"Pizza was too oily, sauce applied on pizza base was too sour in taste & they did not even cut pizza in slices as well."
Please introduce an app for Apple phones.....
Awesome pizzas 🍕 . Must try 9 cheesy Pizza .
"Bad experience in first time order...Quality of pizza base is BAKWAS... This was my first & last order.. There is msg on app that ""Food is ready""...Waiting for delivery boy"" even after food is delivered..."
Very late delivery nd also not delivering hot pizzas
The pizzas are good. But the order delivery times need to be improved. Received moderately warm pizzas on my last order.
Suprb 🤩🤩
"Delicious, thanks for surprised lava cake with my order 🍰"
