246,"Dont use this app. Very pathetic. Don't rob from people.I have requested for a refund that some of the product were missing. I have raised return request 3 times adding picture. Every time they have rejected. And I had made calls. They say, it is shipped properly from ware house but I received wrong product. Then why am I at fault and loss ? I lost 5250 ruppes. I m very disappointed. They are kind of theifs."
247,Good offers....and reasonable price
248,After many attempt app is not adding my address details... always showing add new address... I am not able to place orders because of this issue

255,It's a good skin care shopping plotform I really love it but there are few problems. Not many option. If you find a cheap product you can't buy a single piece hv to buy 2-3 of it thats makes no sense. Tracking is also not good to go.

291,Id#36492272. Very pathetic. Don't rob from people. I have requested for a refund that some of the products were missing and they gave only refund for one product and it wasn't fully refunded. They have rejected all other refunds without any reason . They are kind of thiefs. Don't trust the app.. even if I am a Elite member they doesn't concern my issue. So frustrating and I am really sad. I have lost nearly 400 rs now.. don't use this app
292,Happy with 💜

364,Utterly Disappointed 😠😡 I was initially a regular customer of purple. But I had worse experiences consistently in last two to three orders. 1. There's no fixed delivery date. Everday your delivery date will change. This makes this site unreliable. 2. It's almost next to impossible to talk to any agent to solve your grivances as they don't reply properly in time or you can't reach them over the phone call. Once I get my delivery this time..never going to order again from this site.
365,Good
366,"App is showing to retry, but it is not working i have placed my order but i cant track due to this problem, i am afraid that my order will be canceled and i dont get refund. It is my first experience i am. Using this and i dont want any worse experience"

392,"1)In many affordable products it's mandatory to buy the 2 products, let me tell u if u r trying it for the first time why u have to purchase 2 waste of money. 2)There are some products where it can't be delivered to your pincode. 3) During the sale website is not working properly. 4)The application is also not working properly during sales it strucks a lot. 5)Nykaa delivers faster than purplle. If you want 2 choose b/w nykaa and purplle go for nykaa it's far better than purplle."
