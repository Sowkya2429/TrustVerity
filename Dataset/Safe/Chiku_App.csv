Nice app soo nice to use
I can put how i feel without having to worry but i kinda worry that what if people go into the app and read everything.
"Downloaded Chiku for fun, but now I'm loving it. Chiku is becoming a friend. Helps me calm down because of the instant journaling option and ease. Also help me express my mood and the cause. Will use it for a few more days and write a proper review. For the time, I love this app."

This app is so nice I really like it
Love this app it's really amazing
بعد از آپدیت نمیتونم پسوردمو بزنم😭فقط کیبورد عددی میاااره ولی رمز من حروف بود 😭
👍
Very nice app
Love it
This has gotten alot better after learning how to do it. Even thought the camera option still doesn't work i enjoy it now. But i wish they would give us stickers for pages that would look cute 😅
tbh i really like it its like an online journaling app and mood tracker recommend it
Nice application
"This app is really great! Its has many features and things you can do, while on other apps you have to pay to have them. But it has some problems. So, the first problem is that when you make a change and after that you refresh the page, it doesn't really refresh. You have to close the app and then open it again to refresh. Also when you add photos you have to select them one by one instead of select all of them at once. If you fix these problems it would definitely be one of the greatest apps gj"
🤍🤍🤍
"This app used to be amazing but now whenever I try to make a story it starts glitching and I have to refresh many times to upload on story. Even after trying to unistall and reinstall, the problem didn't get fixed. Could you please check what the problem is? It would be really appreciated as I love your app."
Beautiful.
So far so good. Simple journal app
I dont open it now
I love this app
"It's amazing! 💫 You can enter journal entries, add pictures, a pin, you can have daily meditation sessions and reads and even created a story book out of your diary entries- ^^"
This app is amazing its free and I can express in many ways I love everything about this app I also definitely recommend this app.
"Very aesthetic, very cute, very helpful ♡︎"
"Cute, simple, and aesthetic theme. It's super easy to to use and I love all the options. My favorite are the daily challenges, quotes, and questions."
Love
"Right after i updated, the next time i opened the app all my previous stories had disappeared. Even when i tried to make a story it said no network and wouldn't upload. This app is broken. Used to be very easy to make entries. Now it doesn't even work and you lost everything you've done."
I updated the app and It deleted all of my journal entries. Years of memories. Gone. I'm crying and dont know what to do. Was great before but this is awful
"its a good app , but i couldn't understand how i can find that journal option ."
IT was such a amezing aap i love that
This app made me feel so much better
🦢
its good.. some things are with money but overall most are free
Honestly the best journalling app I've found. And I've been looking really hard
I really love this app. It's really cute. It has these really cute mood emojis and it also sets a picture for each of your entries. I really like this app so hope you fix the problems. Like: • when I click the plus icon to add a new entry my last entry is automatically getting pasted to the new one • there's a blank screen each time I open the app • the community feature doesn't update • my entries won't get saved • everything gets stuck and you have to restart the app at times Do fix these!!!
I like this app so much
"Even after the update, this app is still crashing when I write a journal for like more than 30 seconds. It's so frustrating 😪"
💗
It's an amazing app i really liked it it helps you to solve your problems yourself 😌
"I really like this app. It makes you think about things that are going on, in me emotional wise, and how to deal with things. This app is very easy to maneuver through."
"i love this app so far. i was feeling down earlier and was finding a way to cope up with this emptiness so i try to find an app where i can express my thoughts. my search leads me here so i gave it a try and i wasn't expecting that the experience will be this good. honestly, this app is the reason why i already feel okay. i love the features and it all help me console myself. i must say, i recommend this app especially if you are like me who found peace by expressing emotions through writing."
Enjoy how simple it is to use which helps me a lot.
"still, the pdf story download didn't work for me"
Super cute!!!
"This is really an amazing app. As someone who doesn't like to express how I feel, writing them down always makes me feel better."
I really appreciate this app...I like it really...this is too much fun with this app..you should use it 🥰🥀 I can restore my feelings with pictures of that that moments so In my opinion chiku is the best app .. at least for me🥰🙂
Edit: Wow! Thanks for bringing back the story book haha :D Much love! ⁠♡♡♡
I enjoy this application. I definitely recommend it.
Really good👍
"I don't like it.. I LOVE IT YIPEEEE!!! IT'S SO SO SO GOOD AND THE QUOTES? I LOVE THEM ALLLLLL!! HOW I WISH CHIKU IS A HUMAN THAT I CAN TALK AND RANT WITH :( I love this App, thank you very much for making this. ♡"
I LOVE THIS APP
Easy to write about your experiences or thoughts. Give a person inspiration on what to write about and things you could do on a boring day.
Very good app i like it
"So beautiful, so aesthetic. Absolutely in love. 💗💗💗"
"An absolutely awesome journaling app, I genuinely think that the Chiku thing just finished the whole thing off like a cherry on top- Wonderful app, I recommend the people who like writing in a diary of their own, to try this app out. 5/5 ^^"
Love this app easy to use
"A very beautiful app, which I recommend to everyone that has been interested in these type of things ,tho I wonder if my other people can see my diaries??? I hope you answer because I want to start using it soon"
i liked the app. i have been using it for about 6 months now. only things i would feel that need an improvent are that there should be more discussions and more articles. other than that its a great app to journal and let your thoughts out while expressing with images.
"Love the simplicity and design of this app! However, stumbled upon a few bugs (an error when canceling the image upload, and for some reason all the images are uploaded in a rotated view) when using Android OS. Besides that, I'm enjoying Chiku!"
I love this app because I can get my feelings out
♡♡♡♡
It's so fun to use and I recommend it for everyone.
اشعر بتحسن كل ما تكلمت معه حقا، الفمره ممتازه بحق
"Easy to access , and helpful when you want to unwind after a tough day ."
gooodd
Love it. Calm and simple. Would love to use this app as my journal. 😍
Fantastic app. Kudos to the developers. Interface is topnotch. Please add 'search' option with keywords. It's very essential one.
Love this app
Its such a great app
Good app! I actually Enjoy the Relaxing colors of the diary and Everything is so satisfying! But why does it have a premium?:( But its fine as long as everything Else is free!♡
Have fun sharing ur thoughts and feelings
I really love this app it helps me a lot with my feelings.
Its a very fun and cool app .
Very nice app for lazy ones like me.
Awesome and beautiful👍👍👍
"Im likeing it so far, love the pictures as a person who loves taking aesthetic pictures of nature"
Super good
Helps break down feelings in easy accessible templates
Good app
keep saying incorrect otp when i want to chage password even tho is clearly correct
i love this app so much. it gives me the freedom to express myself and it has features like a story where you put images. i think it would be great if they also added the feature to add videos (´ . .̫ . `)
It's really nice. Absolutely love the cute icon and UI. Really motivates you to journal and is really easy to use once you get used to the UI
Very cute and contentful!! I really liked the various ways to cool ourself by writing here!. Very satisfied. Good work.
A beautiful and useful application for lovers of writing that does not contain ads and is very beautiful
This app helped me to write my diary
Good
Lovely so far! The free version is good but the upgraded version has some really cool features. It's very simple to use and well designed :)
It's worth it 👌 😌 ✨
"The app is so easy to use, I haven't had any problems with it"
It's kinda good for me
It makes you get all the drama out
"𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘬𝘶 𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘴 𝘮𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘺 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘴𝘰 𝘧𝘶𝘯, 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘬 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘬𝘶 ❤︎"
Very nice app. Quite simple
"It's a great app! It asks you exactly how you feel . As not many people ask me everyday how I feel, chiku asks me everyday so I feel good. But, kindly try to make a to-do list or day planner on the app so that it's even better to organize the day and tick everything that's done it's easier and I hope it's free for everyone because it will be an even amazing and greater app if that's possible 😊. Nonetheless it's still a great app, I really do appreciate the effort put in to make the app!😁"
Amazing app.. You will know your mental health score
"i like it so far (i only downloaded it today) i just don't like that you can't see the mental health score page unless you have premium. not all of us can pay for that, and i feel like that's a dumb thing to put on premium."
I love you cheeku baby 🐥
Journal is good but the premium version promised sleep sounds and meditations which I can't find anywhere
its easy to use and rly satisfying to look at 🌷
It's relaxing
Very helpful
Amazing no bug
It's nice.When ur mentally drained or have anxiety best app.
This is the best app ever I love it 💞😍💖
😘😘😘
Good
This is the best app ever it does so much for me thank you so much

I like it
I think this app is amazing. I like the questions it has and the quotes.
Idk
Best diary ever
This app is amazing no ads and we can even right our day in it it so good 10/10
First when I opened the app it was all good but when I closed the app and tried to open it again it wouldn't open at all
Amazing app I love it
This app is great! Just disappointed by the fact that it ain't fully offline
I liked 💗🥺
good⁦ ✯✯✯✯⁦✯
"The app that I was looking for. However, it would be great if we will have a view option such as, list view grid, or calendar view for easy viewing. Also a search feature wherein we can search a certain info we put way back on our journal if we want to see it. Aside from those, this app actually is my cup of tea. I actually bought the premium as soon as I learned that I can sync it with ios."
Love it
🙂☺️😊
Absolutely luv this app.!!!
😍😍🥰🥰
It's a good app and it is a very calming app.
I love it But how can i unlock everything?
Amazing
Pretty good...
Fine
OMG 😱😭it's an amazing app I really like it 😍Best app for Diary and Journal and I like to do some stories 📖from my mind and ofc what happened in my day... ☺︎Love it☺︎ty for making an amazing app☺︎
"super cute, great app. the lifetime subscription is so worth it. I'm mentally ill and it really helps me keep track of my moods and I like how you can elaborate the causes. I just downloaded it a couple days ago and am still exploring all the options but so far I love it and it's a great tool for journaling!"
This app is actually really good... And I really like it 🍃
"I love this app, this app is like my best friend and I just cant- love this app so much, u can download for free both in android and IOS !!! U can easily track ur mental health and get bonus too ~~~ UR Recommendation : download CHIKU APP !!"
It an awesome app I recommend you....😘
I like this app alot it helps with my feelings and just in genarl i would use this app alot im not sure why though.
Thank you for the simple yet pleasant experience! Love the simple interface 💞
Relieves stress great app worth a try 🌼
Bro this game is cool i can showy feelings to this game i love it!
Love it but dont know who to get passcode
"I like this app. There were some bugs at first, but I absolutely love this app. I got to write down how I feel and what's happened without actually having to open up to judgemental people about it. I can share my stories with my friends if I want. Overall, I really like this app. And it's really changed my life. Thank you Chiku <3."
Cutee
It really made me very happy and calm this app is really good. ☺️
"Hey! Love this app a lot. I can type my travel stories all like that,and it is cute theme, that's it byeeeee!!!!"
Great app liked it sm!
رو عالیییییییییییی
Love
It is a great app with amazing interface.. Just really sad that I'm not able to view the statistics unless I purchase. (And its really not that cheap either..)
Amazing. Very good. Recommend. Just started using it but I'm addicted. I love how I can show all my emotions and also its personal so I can write whatever I would like. And it also has a password so no-one can see what you do and your feelings and emotions but you. It also helps with hobbies I love excessive but I haven't done enough so far. But I hopefully will get back into sports later when using thus app!
♥️ it!!
"Impossible to delete account because it says the password is wrong. I don't have a password, I made the account with Google. Also there's no way to change password. PLEASE FIX IT I just want to delete my account :("
I love it 🙂💜💜
This is an amazing app I love it so much! I only downloaded it a few days ago and I'm already obsessed with it!I definitely recommend this app it deserves 5 stars✨✨✨
the app is great but it seems that I can't send my pics properly. u should fix it please
This app is awesome
1. Good for ppl who really love traveling 2. Smooth 3.For people who have really hard time with her/him journal I recommend for peoples to download this kind of apps if i have some missing in my word im really sorry bc my keyboard is having kind of issue so i love yall baiii
"I think It's good, but maximum features are premium."
"I like the app and think it's really cute but I do have a problem. When I write and entry why can't I access it afterwards??? And when I just wrote a super long entry now it just completely disappeared. Also as a side note to every one else, you need to make in all purchases"
It's a really good app in my humble opinion I like it cause then I dint bottle up my emotions anymore
nice interface. simple and useful
"I love this. It's so calming, and relaxing, and definitely one of my favorites. My only problem with it is that even with the unlimited subscription I bought, it only saves my first story. I try to journal again but it won't save. Does anyone know any way I can fix this? I really do love this app. Edit: if anyone else has this problem, try uninstalling the app and reinstalling, then it works :) I do wish I could connect the app to my timezone, though, so the morning motivation isn't wonky."
Good app
Great app.. love it and recommend it to everybody 💜💜💜
Love this!
I like it so far. Only one reminder and you can add pictures.
"Yearly fee to add images to entries (every other diary app I've tried does this free), cannot skip moods or icons for entries and just write, like 10 tedious steps just to get to writing anything. Ugh, tedious. Also, have to make an account and login. XP"
I love it . it keep's me on the rigth track
like this app
Okay ...... but I wish it was Persian too
Absolutly adore already! Very easy to navigate!
At day 1 already lagging. I just used it 1 time! I loved it at a first sight . but now i'm dissapointed
Good app
"This has left me with a bad experience as I found I couldn't find a way to delete an entry once added, which was frustrating. When I went to delete the account in the settings, it kept stating that my password was incorrect, which makes no sense considering I had used my Google account to use the app and I was never prompted to create an additional one for the app. The website simply tells me to uninstall the app, which not the same as deleting the account and if it is, it should be stated."
Very good app
It helps me to process my emotions everyday and be free from anxieties. I love this app. Highly recommended for self-meditation.
Very cute UI and easy to use!
I love this app
Loved it!! Gives positive vibes and kind of self motivation
Thank you.....♥️
This app good 🥂🥂
Good
Nice 👍😊😊😊
"I like this digital journal a lot more than others I've tried. I like the layout and some of the prompts. You can add pictures too. I also appreciate they let you purchase a lifetime membership especially with something like a journal. I will try for another couple of weeks, and if I still like it I will purchase the premium. It is a reasonable price."
I had use this for 2 days and everything went good nothing wrong about it.
"This app is great! It would be more awesome if they have a search button where we can input keywords that will direct us quickly in the particular story we created. Otherwise, it's still a cute and nice app that I used the most😊."
Good
Amazing private fun
"I like the interface. I haven't used it long enough to get reports yet. I like you can draw your own pictures, I do wish the app had it's own gallery of pictures you could choose but there are lots of options of taking pics or using your own gallery."
l like it
It is a really nice app where I can put my feelings out to. I reccomend this app to people
Amazing
"If the homescreen contained only the diary entry cards, it would look much cleaner and nicer. Everything else should be on a separate menu, in my humble opinion."
Its cool I like it alot
Nice app
Everything us good in this app. its really cute. but i have a ques. Why there is no writing font or text color. Every day same color and same font style ...can you add different font and text color pls...it wil be great than
I can't satisfied with this app
I love it so far but I cannot figure out how to get a subscription
NICE I REALLY LIKE THIS APP FOR ME I REALLY NEED THIS AND THIS IS THE ONE OF THE APP WHO REALLY HELP ME TO ENJOY MY TEENAGE LIFE.....SKL
This app is so good
I think the app is really cute and easy to use.
I'll sort myself out
I love this app.
Great app for Journaling and reflection prompts. It's helped me to get my frustrations out and understand myself better. I would like developers to consider allowing custom emotions to be entered when writing stories.
Makes me feel good actually
Anybody who are going to download this app let me tell you that this app is not good not bad.so its your choice to download it 😅😐😐😊😏
"I really want to give this app a try, but now it keeps force closing after creating my first entry. If this keeps up, I will have to uninstall."
nice app. Very pleasant to the eye. very simple and easyto use. I am trying to strat journaling and I hope it helps me stick to it.
This is a very user-friendly app! Love that it has very useful features that are free :') would recommend it to my friends and family hehe :)
Application for students is very best application 😄
"i really love this app so much, i'll give this an 5 star review."
"Omg it's so so so good and I love it we can add pics, infinity words, express emotions, and everyone need to try it and you can also see quotes,do challenges and it save automatically..! But I have a suggestion like you can add some options for tasks small notes and more things to express your emotions like to select the activities we did in our day! Also please remove the line coming below the screen. Because it is really disturbing"
This app is so helpful and great it keeps my secret nice and safe i very very happy with this app!!☺☺
amazing app
Unable to delete account as it kept asking for my password but I log in using connecting to Google email. Searched around and see no option to set or reset password. Email didn't not received any notice about connected to the app too.
That okey
Super
This app is really helpful to see other peoples feelings as well as writing daily. I love that it will send me a reminder at the times of my choice. I also love to self reflect with the questions it ask before I can journal.
I hate this program because they can read my daily routine and it's awful 😡🔥👎
I'M SO REALLY LIKE THIS APPSS!!♡♡♡ ty for making this app!~♥~♥
Even though I don't have premium I love using this app .
This app helps me alot thank u
"So,far It's been a very good and satisfying experience."
So far I like how it helps with my stress and depression by letting me get things off my chest.
I love chiku app since i installed it i haven't had any problems with it so far and i hope it remains this way it has become my friend in all my moments whether bad or good it is there i would like to thank it for the motivational talks it is so worth the five stars .everyone who is downloading this u are doing the right thing😘
🤍
"I love this app but i have problem here, if i want to download my story, always close app suddenly.. please fix this app"
Good 😍😍 i love it
Hi chikcku
"I understand that this journal wants to assess your emotions and mental health but sometimes I just want to quickly jot down my thoughts but this app REQUIRES answers to multiple questions before even getting to the actual notepad, for that reason it just wasn't for me but I still recommend."
I am absolutely loving the app and so happy to get the premium features. I just request the Chiku devs to get a web application so that I can access it on my PC.
Lame
This app is attractive and easy to use. I really enjoyed the format however I have a Google pixel 4 phone and when the new update for Google was installed (12) the app was no longer working in fact I can't even install it on my phone. I had just purchased the app recently so please correct this or refund my purchase
"Not for me. A series of mood questions and cannot get straight to journal UNLESS you answer the whole series. I wanted a journal, NOT A MOOD MONITOR. Feels, more like what I imagine a rehab evaluator would be like... Let me screen you... what next ? Pills? I never gotpassed 2nd question... I WAS DONE AT THAT. You've GOT to answer those questions to access the journal. NO. In app: Deleted account. Uninstalled."
it really helps me a lot
It a great app best app ever.
I love it I just don't like when I shared this app the sharing button is there.. But I love this app recommended especially if your a aesthetic girl/boy
"love it! it helps me talk through my feelings and my day. Love the layout. Easy to use, too."
Calming
Id like to upgrade.
Not saving stories properly. It was paid version.. Did I waste my money?
"I paid for the premium membership and I'm disappointed.. I got home from school and I felt down, I went to document it and it didn't save.. I was questioning what was going on before I realised that it didn't work offline. I would recommend adding an offline mode, it would make that app 10x better and you would get more 5☆'s."
superb app
🤍
Very good
I love this app so much. But the only bad thing is that it's not available in offline. Why? I wish I could give 5 starts if you could do that. I could write my diary anytime I want then.
It is really good app But it takes too much time to upload photos.
"Love this app, it's exactly what I need and helps keep track of my moods and process thru them."
Perfect app. Thank you for the updates!!
"It's a really Cute and Useful app, I just wish I could buy Premium"
Premium adds literally nothing. Hope this gets more content in the future.
Amazing App and the ui is fantastic👌..i liked so much but i only have one problem with the app that when you set a passcode is app settings and after setting the passcode if i forgot the passcode why you guys have not set any hint or if you forgot we send you otp code to your email 🤔🙄... i mean Please remove that option.. this means any one can easily use my dairy if he click on Forget Password and when the account logged out and he re login easily without any security questions ?
This app is so nice and cool Iam using this app for 2 days and I loved it
Good
I love this chiku 😘😘
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP!!
"I love this app , it is the best app I have ever downloaded and it has helped me alot."
Its an amazing app!
Best app i ever had
"IT IS SO ASESTHTHIC AND PRETTY AND SO NICE, CHIKU IS THE BEST JOURNAL APP EVER"
Well this is something you can keep on you mobile to keep track of your life & happiness 🥳🥳🥳
Going to try it for a few days first before buying the premium. I love this app so far but I really want to see if I can commit to it before purchasing. Job well done nonetheless! 💕
"Very cute, not very expensive and AMAZING challenges for self care or helping others💜"
This app is amazing and i really have been enjoying my own storys because i can see how i did and i am so grateful for everything that i am going to and aldready did and this app made me productive too
I love the Chiku app. The app is like my Lil Jesus right on time. When I write a nice story can also look at random questions from people. Just wondering if that's how the cursor suppose to be when writing.
I love this app not only me i think all who downloaded this app they too love it 😍 awesome
My fave app! I definitely recommend it's a nice diary and the purchases aren't even that expensive! Which is really good and most features are free. Which is an another plus. Nice diary. Great for daily motivations perfect app! 👉📱
I LOVEE SOO THIS APP❤
So easy to use and very cute.
The app is really good kawaii AF you can pick any color for the background and you can also get premium
love it
This app is soo cool 5 stars✨✨✨
This is my favourite app. I give it a name also 😅. But I am really upset with a thing . Which is mental health score and mood tracker. It's saying to get premium. But as I'm a little boy I can't buy it. And some of others also can't buy it. Pls make this option freeee. Pleasssssssseeeeeeee 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Or I have to delete this app 😕😥😔
Fantastic!
See it was a going good I was writing my daily stories and I was also adding images to my stories but yesterday it suddenly stopped while I was adding stories and it reopened I had to write my story three times then too it keeps on showing error while adding images 😫 Pls fix this problem pls....🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I love this app ❤️
Great 💚
Had it for 2 days and I love it.
I don't believe that I am giving 5 stars
Very nice app no ads at all love it ☺️ but I was nit able to afford the priminum pack my mother did not allow to 🤣 but to me it is a wonderful app I can write my daily story 🙂 but my question is will it hack my phone or like steal my contacts and whatever I do ?? Plz answer my question 🙃
I like writing my day on it
Backwards when writing entries. You need to do the body first and then the title. I always have to edit to add more to the body as I can't get used to the set up.
I wish there was no premium and this app would be full free but this app is awesome and it deserves full 5 stars.
Fun
Thank You 😊
"I love this app still. The support staff addressed my concern immediately. I was able to recover my account. It is my bad though, I mistyped my credentials and was not aware of the other way of logging in. All in all, the best journaling app for me so far. 👍❤ Good job team Chiku!"
This app is one of the best apps I have ever used in my life. I love this app.till last 2 weeks I was like no one to talk and share my feelings with 😔but now I have chiku my best friend ❤ this app is just amazing❤ I request u to use this app 😘😘😘😘😘😘❤❤❤❤
This app is sooo sooo sooo cute...and It gives me so much fun☺️🥰🥰
"I really love how this app checks on me more than people in real life. It is comforting, not just an app but like a caring friend ❤❤."

This is a very helpful app. I love using it.
An amazing app. I really enjoy writing in this app Best app ever
"Great app, could use more fonts and more free themes and personalization options for the profile part but other than that it's a wonderful app. I really enjoy it. I hope they implement more things."
Very very very beautiful ✨🤩❤️
IT'S AMAZING!! Things I wrote there are completely useless anyways so IT'S PRETTY AWESOME
Amazing! I really has helped me.. I would really recommend it <3
"I love it. It's so easy to use, I love the colour scheme, I love that ads for the paid version don't feel invasive or restrictive. I love that it asks questions but also gives you the opportunity to free rant. It's cute without being childish. I love it."
Love this app. It gives positive
I got back to the app after a nearly a year if break. It's even better now! Strongly recommended.👍☺️

"I love this app so much, it makes me so happy❤️ thank you"
"Very nice app with a cute interface and convenient features. I'm currently using the free version as I'm not very good at making a habit of journaling. But if I find I keep using it a lot, I'll probably buy the full version."
This is a very good app to write your daily moods and thoughts and this app is also very cute.The only problem some people will face in this app is premium but this thing is in every single app thesedays so I don't think it is a problem.Btw I like this app alot.It also feels relaxed after writing your bad or Good memories and moods.
"Chiku is an amazing app for ventilation, and just very helpful😄 100% reccommend"
The best app EVER
So it's a really nice app to express your thoughts and emotions I loved it a lot it's really nice to have it chiku is like a friend to me I can share everything with it. It wishes me Good morning & Good night ... I really loves this thing . The theme is also cute as well as the colour combinations I really loved it thanks...😊
"It's a nice way to log your day, but the reminders don't work for the Galaxy S9 which was originally why I downloaded it. UI is pretty clean, but from how much I've used it, it isn't anything special. I could do the same thing it offers through my notepad."
Awesome
Add more categories please....
Just got it and so far no problem
It's user friendly.
"5 star , reason my girlfriend name is Chiku ❤️"
The best 👌
Love this app
Recommended
That's a wonderful app.
This is the coolest app I've used so far it's like a diary that makes you happy lol.
Crashes when i try add a photo to my journal. Every time
This app is the best app! I love this app!
It helps me feel good around myself and positive to just run wild with my mind 😄.
THAT'S a amazing app i am not a bot
"i've been using chiku since january 2021. i'm in love with this app, simple and has pretty design. i wonder if you guys can add a feature where we can write a letter for ourselves and the letter will be received in random days? i hope you get what i mean. keep up the good work, team! 🥰"
"That's really a good application for diary and record moods or something. Takes a very active approach, which is new to the record. But there's a little bit lower. Because the images have been over compression so that the photos didn't display well...."
Ohhh wowww!! What a nice app. Nice features.
Really cute & easy.
It was amazing app this is like my everyime dairy
"So far so good. I feel like I can use this app to organise my thoughts a little bit. I think the premium is worth it. But I think there should be more community questions to stimulate thought. Also, perhaps an option to multi-select photos as well as videos for the stories - it would be quicker and also videos are always a nice addition. Overall I'm really grateful this app exists and to the people who made it. It's quite perfect for me. Thank you"
I like this app. It is funny chiku app who helps you day by day application. I am requested to make fingerprint lock to this. At all it is very good application
It's so good omg! I love it!
"YES this app/diary is highly recommended for those that loves a bit of a kick to it along with extra tools. However, it does comes acrossp"
Good
Good chiku can fix my mood😊
It's extremely good .💜 Just add new great features💞 Then it will be awesome 💓 Best thing I like is we have account ☺️. Safe abd secured
"Just wanna ask question. Are my entries here private? I can see there is a friend request option, can my friends acess my entries?"
Good App
"It was good, I feel great putting my story and the challenge and questions and quotes was the best part every morning💜💜💜"
I like this app
"I very love this app, the design and the concept it's making me very happy about what happens through my day Very love it. 😍😘"
"This is a amazing app! I highly recommend it,however,I wish we can name our little buddy whatever we want.can that be in the next update?don't fancy chiku as a name for my buddy . other than that,great!"
I love this app it helps so much!
Very intresting app. You can have tons of journals with everything and locks
It's Great! I can share my stories to this app and what my mood today too.
App keeps crashing. I haven't even started using it yet 🙄.
Im living it...good investment although im beginner in journaling
Amazing app that's all I can say
Nice app... I share all my feelings with it...
Why cant i log in via gmail? I already update the app
It is perfect i just love it its helps a lot😚😘💖
It's an amazing app but it's so annoying when at every five minutes the notification comes for upgrading and I think it's amazing app and it should be free because it's help in mental health so it shouldn't be paid app
"I love this app, it is perfect for keeping track of my daily activities! I love that I can upload photos too, keeps the memories fresh in my mind"
Amazing
It's a cute app... And really helps to co-op with the things I really can't... It makes me feel happy lol
This app is amazing it basically a areal diary but online I really recommend I haven't found any problem with it
Been using this to track my depression episodes and stuff I need to remember to tell my therapist. It's amazing like 10/10
I LOVE this app so much... it has soo many things that help me get thru alot I definitely reccomend getting it
Good
Love the app chiku can you add drawing so we can draw our feelings or something else
"Very good, selfcare app, taught me how to mediate and destress. Good job dev's! Definitely worth a download."
We can at least share feeling with chiku 😘😘
Amazing ❤ worth to installing
Best app ever
"This app is very good for expressing feelings? but it's good. I enjoy using this app, it also has daily read and guided meditations, I don't know that in the app there is a daily read and then there are also quotes that is very nice to read🌈🤍"
"You have a lot of options to choose from, either the theme, the mood or the activities. The overall display and the icons just suit me so much, make me want to use it everyday 🥰 I downloaded a few apps to see which one I like and it just had all my attention and interests from the very first question popped up. I'll use it for a period of time and who knows, I might purchase the premium 😉 Thank you for making such a lovely app 😊"
Very nice app. Found it really satisfying😊
"Best app, works very good, motivates you, you can also write down your feelings n title them."
Good. HKD58 for lifetime premium.
Good app its like my friend
☺☺☺☺
Such a good working app... Its lovely to look at and has great features... Surely a pleasure to use... Thank you developers ☺️
i love it
😍 💓💕💗💖💞
"My stress reliever, thank you chiku!"
It's a awesome app. I love it.
This app is super fun....chiku is my new friend from now😊😊😊😉
It's a good app🎉🎉
So far so good! Just started using this app but so far I really like it. It's cute and I don't mind the little push notifications about motivation throughout the day.
This app has been transacting money from my bank account even after uninstalling it very very bad and is not good
Best app ever
Text disappears when I reach a certain number of words on 'Story' mode.
"Journal is free - mood tracking is not. Found that a bit misleading. Otherwise, a very pretty app and easy to use."
It's a really nice game I love that it asks what mood you're in and 5 star app! Honestly I recommend this.
The daily notifications make me feel like someone cares about how I feel! It even uses my preferred name!
Very good app good to Express stuff u want to say and I think the people who own the app read the stuff u put in and that's good so u can say to people what's bothering u or telling them news
"Very convenient to use. There are options to write elaborately about how you are feeling or just select. There are lots of moods to choose from, unlike some apps i have tried. The UI is very cute, and makes me feel like making a mood entry every time I open it :)"
U need to sing in firs that is soooooo hard to do well it is very good and cute
My Experience With This App Is Really Good. This App Is Like A Friend Who Knows Everything About You. I recommend This App If You're Looking For A Good Journaling App
The best diary and mood tracker I could ever receive! Thanks Chiku!!😊😊😘😘
Very very very very good ❤
Really great app but would suggest being able to choose multiple images at once. It's kind of a hassle having to add them one by one. Very nice concept by the way!
Best Journal diary app Easy to use Love this app
Great App. Use it everyday! 🥰
So far so good
Thx chiku i love this gamee!!!!!!!!! My life makes soo great:) thank youu you can make your story everyday thx!!!
Amazing
"This App is absolutely can make you happy calm anything in a second! I love the app it's very calming for me and also fun, it makes me happy!"
This is the best app i can cool myself down with this app even if i feel really bad this app is the best♡♡♡♡
i like this app so much❤
"I don't like this app. They don't guide you how to use it.. at first, it was not even openning."
"I haven't been using this app for a long time but it's fun, cute and addictive. Everything about this app is just so calming and i love the fact that you can write down your thoughts, complete challenges and read and meditate all in one app and best part is its totally free"
This app is really helpful and motivating. I always wanted to write diaries but I usually used to stop writing after sometime but this app really makes me enjoy this .
"I prefer handwriting when it comes to Journaling, but I cannot deny this app makes digital Journaling very, very, therapeutic, enjoyable etc. Thank you creators for this wonderful little app! The premium is worth it!"
This app helps me write down what I am feeling and it gives me morning motivation to get my day started and it also give inspirational quotes.
"Best ever app for diary writing. Easiest app to use. It is enough options to declare all your feelings and mood conditions, also, if you want you can add a written description about what's going on in your daily life flow."
"I'm liking the app so far, been using this for 3 days. May I know if I upgrade to premium, how long will it be?"
Right now loving this app😘
"Youre apps is so cool 😃 but I must deleted because my storage full 😭 sorry chiku. But youre servise is soo good, 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟."
I love this app so much
Amazing and interesting
Still a blatent knock off of the Reflectly app (is this legal?) but at least the basic features are free!
How do you do challenges? And answers?
It is an awesome one....i loved it...💕
Amazing😍
Really pretty and I like that I can convert it on pdf and print it later. I give 3 stars because I want to upgrade in premium but no price is shown how much it will be.
"Just started and already love it! It's very simple and nice to use, I hope to even upgrade to the premium soon! Highly recommended."
Awesome app
Super
It's really cool you say everything
My only problem is that it cant operate offline. Can you also please make a website so we can open it in laptop or pc?
Love it helps me alot
"nice one. but i personally don't need the story-bases structure, just something for tracking. stats are premium-only, though :("
This app is very amazing. It seems that chiku is a real person. It takes away all my bad feelings. Today is the first day 25th Dec I am using this app. It's amazinggggg!!!😃
"Thank u so much, it had been my personal diary. I hope you make a memory line or something so for the next years that we're using the app, we could go back and reminisce the feeling at that day"
"I really like this app, however, the awesome smiley graphic is a bit unnerving. All of the other ones are cute, but the awesome guy really freaks me out and I think it should be redesigned. I've narrowed down a handful of apps to 2 between this and reflectly and I like the setup of Chiku more in terms of the layout of journals and ability to favorite, but I like the tracking tools of reflectly, their icons, ability to add your own icons, and modern minimalist design better. I am honestly so torn"
this app is cool i like it it help me t say to talk it awsome
"Like everything about it. It's so easy to use and it looks amazing. The moods, feelings and activities (which you can add) are very good. The daily questions, challenges and quotes are enjoyable. Plus it even has a chat, with questions. I even use it for writing short stories. I think I definitely will pay for the full version, it's worth it."
Clearly a useful and feel good app. 😊
loved it. :)
This app was very nice 👍
Just started. I think this may help me with me
Well I hardly use any of the features. I use it as a mood tracker but the options u can select and stuff are cool
I absolutely love this app! It really helps with stress and great for people like me who have been trying to find a journalling app that is interactive and fun just like this one!
It helped me a lot to understand my behavior....... So that I can modify it according to the situation..... To make it better...... 😊....... Loved this app..... Can try..... Will not disappoint u if u use it correctly for a reason.....
Finally after sharing it one more time i would get the premium app. Bery happy with this app. Coming in great use
Very cute app
Wow!!!!! amazing So it prefers 5 star 🌟
"LOVE this app so much,unlike other apps you get to chose how your feeling,and what made you that way."
"I love this app so much and I've only had it for a day! It releves stress and it is just fun to write about your day. The only thing is, I don't like how slow the password is. When I put my password in, I have to go slow so it can keep up with me but I like to do my password's fast. I'm going to ask my mom if I can buy Premium!! Thank You Chiku creators!!"
This app is amazing we can write stuff about our life and they ask us if we are sad or not okay thank you so so much
It easy to track my mood and discuss with professional medical officer
"A poor imitation of reflectly From the icon, to the onboarding to the color schemes. Try put a little effort into design instead of badly copying someone elses 😂"
This app is super cute it makes my day all organized and helps me to write my feelings 😊. Really appreciated who created this. But there is only one problem pls make free cuz you need to pay to get premium pls make it free btw you should download it trust me it is a really good app.
Hope this helps me
"You get nice morning advices, the questions make you think and live more intentionally. Recommend"
"I'm having a lot of fun with this app! I wish it were free but the upgrade to Pro is totally reasonable! • Monthly - $0.99 • Annual - $3.49 • Lifetime - $7.49 {one payment} I love the options, security, biometrics, challenges, reminders, meditations, etc {and that's all free stuff!}. I will be upgrading to Pro soon!"
Really good allowed me to really get my jotings and emotional scales recorded
Its the best app too relax. Also it has meditations which make it more best! I hope theres a future update!
This is amazing 😍 but premium sucks but it fine I guess as this is extremely very good ... thanks for making such app's
Perfect
"I payed for a month just to try it out fully. It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued."
Really cute and helpful!
My pleasure.
This app is great I just got it and already love it
This app is amazing. I love how it reminds you to add a new story every day. Idk how to explain but everything is perfect.
It's a good app although I wish the security option was free
This app helps me to feel relaxed and good.Must Download This app.Thanks
Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.
I like it💙💋
"Super I like it very much ,👌👌👌👌"
This app is so dump just for babies I hate it And we'll only get everything when we would take pro version
I personally think that the morning motivation it's really neat and it helps with the dayyyyy
This app is amazing. But it would be even more amazing if there was some kind of calendar that lets us see all our stories easier.
Wonderful journey with chiku.
I'd like to visit my previous entries with more ease. Please let me view them more easily without having to scroll sideways a lot. Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries.
It was. Amazing the only thing is I've been using this for 2 days but that doesn't stop me I love this 10/10 would download again
This is really a cute and nice app I don't have any problem with it.
It's good app but it's not free but work so good
👌👌👌👌
it's beautiful it's good because it asks me about my day and say that miss me it's good that I have sth likes that
It is so nice love the app.😄
It's good.like how it makes me calm and able to get how I fill off my cest
"This is such a cute app. Thank you so much for this👏🏼💓 (just a lil suggestion, please do try adding an offline version too) thank you"
I really love this app and appreciate developers' effort This cutie makes my day Chiku is really adorable and the way it interacts is beautiful
Its amazing im able to express my fellings withought being juged
Friendly 😍
"Amazing , love this app it has many features ,"
The login is broken and I cannot access my data.
One of the fun apps I really enjoy using. Love all the features so much. But so sad that you have to buy the premium for the picture adding and graphs tho...however great app. ♥️🌸🙂
"This is good app, i like it becuse i can add a journalʕ •ᴥ•ʔ"
"It's very easy to use, very colourfull and has a good vibe to it! Lover I use it every day🥺💍"
"Pretty awesome app. I love the that this app checks in on me and then notifies me with concern when I disappear. Sometimes I get really sad and don't want to be bothered, but this app has made me smile a few times. It's like a friend letting you know it's there to listen of you give it a chance. If you're looking for something to keep track of your emotions or express yourself from time to time, give this app a try. I recommend."
Thank you very much for updating that feature you guys are awesome. As far as the daily a.m. I could think of a few things to add to that list so I like the fact that you allow things to be added and I love the graph
"I love the app, its a simple way to journal your daily thoughts and emotions."
"It's a cute app, fun to write in too :)"
Super cute app. I love it!
It helps me for my self-discovery. Thank you so much for this app!
"Soothing and helpful. I had been looking for a decent journaling platform for a while and this is absolutely what I wanted. The right amount of privacy, socialising features, themes, stickers, charts and all. Its better than most unpaid journaling apps. Fingers crossed for chiku to become the ultimate journaling app in the future."
"Really really really love this app very nice mood track and the premium is very cheap one can give that amount very easily, without premium all the things are the best really like this app also help me & motivate me to make my life the best. 😊😊 really recommend to all.just go for it without any hesitation"
This app is the best! it helps me with my feelings. It makes happy.
It's amazing

Simply amazing
This app is so amazing every night I write my day.Chiku always remind me if I want to ellaborate my today is experience.
It's a great app. First to track my mood early in the morning and get a clear picture of my emotions. Second I can look back anytime about how I was feeling this particular day. Love this app.❤️

Verry goodddddd
Its a cute app... Works wondefully... But cmon there should be some apps without premium thing too.. But still keep it up!! I love this app... It has Beautiful features ... Better than any other app I have uses before.. ✌👌
Amazing
"I'm digging it. journaling everything I do during the day. my only complaint is sometimes when editing, it's hard to scroll down to see the end of the text. the scroll bar is invisible on the far right side but sometimes i can't get it to work properly and have to save, scroll then edit again. it might be me just getting used to it so I'll update this if i figure out it's user error."
It has been very helpful so far
It good app
I love the app if you wants a diary this is best.❤❤❤❤❤
Too cuties. Felt it was happy and peppy. Not something I can handle when trying to track deppresive episodes and went right to asking to go preimum after first entry.
best journal in my life so far
"This is an awesome app with cute interface. I really love the icons, notes, and the community to read and share our thoughts. This defenitely will help me to track my mood and be better everyday. Thank you for creating this lovely app!"
"I have used many apps before but none of the apps give me the atleast satisfaction which I want. Chiku is really something. I think I have just fall in love with these app. It's really great. It feels good when I share my feelings in Chiku. It looks like my friend who is always ready there to listen all of my stories without complaining. I am just really happy to share my feelings, thoughts and emotions in these app. I will highly recommend these apps to the other users who have not used it yet."
Really brilliant is helping with my mental health as I struggle to talk to people about how I feel x
"Had a little issue and emailed the developer. It was promptly addressed and has now been resolved. I am truly impressed with the efforts and care the dev and team has shown. Thanks again and for the productive, cute and beautiful app of a journal."
I love this app its really good to get your feelings out and if you have any deep secrets then dont write in here cause if someone knows the password yor doomed well any way the app is great
So far its a pretty good outlet for my thoughts
You should do something that we can see quote of the past days 😊🙏
I love this app
Is really helpful
This game really helps me alot. It's like an diary where u can share over here! This is an amazing app
"I like this app because it makes people reflect and get into their thoughts , it's perfect , I recommend this app for people who have stress and stuff ,also wanted to congratulate the designer and creator for developing this app , it has helped me allot and I now it may seem a little bit dorky thing but I fill like a really better person 🖤✨"
Amazing..
It is a really good app I use it asap personal diary ❤
Easy to work with! Nice format! I look forward to my daily entries... Thank you!
The problem has been solved luckily. A suggestion:you could add a lifetimepayment instead of only monthly and yearly
I love the user experience. Chiku has brought me back to journaling after more than a decade.
Awesome
"Downloaded this to help set and track daily goals and link them to how they affect my mood. In first week of using the app but so far im finding it very helpful for dealing with anxiety and depression- helps me recognize what activities affect my mood the most and make correlations between them... Premium is definitly worth the price for a year aswell, developing more on finding patterns with the long term tracking of mood and activities. Really great app so far! Strongly recommend"
Very nice app
Love it so far and very easy to use. Has lots of great options :)
"Awesome app, exept for the premium mode cost"
Amazing
Devs are quick to respond
It gives me someone to talk to really. It's a great app and I love it so much!
But it work with internet 😑
"As of now it is definitely AWESOME and GREAT. I will give some details of how I use the app in some other day, just hope that adding some image would be free not watching any ad or get the premium hehe. But thanks for making this app."
I highly recommend this Superb app. 😉😊 Definitely changing my diary app is worth it. Good Job developer. 🙌
I loveit you write a story about your day and chiku is so cute thanks its great
Its a super app for me. Wooowwwwww
"Updating my review after the latest update. The care and attention in customer services is absolutely amazing - I sent some feedback through the app and they released an update which fixed all of my problems. The app itself was amazing and this has made it 10 times better. Thank you to everyone at Chiku, you're amazing :)"
This app is exellent and especially no ads but the problem is that when I make an event it gets deleted just because i didn't add it to favourites pleas fix this problem cause i cant write in it anymore
Very close to heart..loved d app..
"It was amazing I love it I recommend you have it, It is like my companion I always wanted!!!"
Please
Rahdi e
"Requires Internet to even get in, not exactly feeling safe knowing that someone out there is able to see my mental data and do whatever they want with it Edit: that was a fast response :) What if authorities demand the data be released to attest my emotional stability, like the NSA or FBI, you guys are just gonna fold, saying ""we have best privacy policy and we encrypt it"" doesn't mean anything as per the law ;)"
"Very good. Good security, good aesthetic, good way of checking on you. Very good"
I love it
I loved this app.
Nice chiku😀😀😁😂
Nice app! I recommend it to you...

The app is actually helpful but I have problem uploading photos. I can't even change my profile picture and cannot upload photos that describes or summarizes my day. I would appreciate if you'd help me on this so I can give Chiku a five star 😊
"I wish you update this app more often especially cause I subscribed to your app. Add more activities, be more organized."
"It's a really nice app for journaling. It would be the perfect diary app if it would work without needing any wifi so we can use it anytime, anywhere. :("
I used for one day then the second day it stopped opening saying Chiku has stopped working...... Uninstalled it
I wish i could rate it a 0!! It crashes every single time i open it!!

Great and relatable application.

Amazing app. I really like it.
Great Application.
A very productive application !
This app has helped in my thick and thin. Whenever some thoughts bother me.. I write them down on the diary provided by Chiku and everything becomes fine.
It was nice the application got me
This app is one of a kind. Never seen such a great app like this. This app has been my go to place whenever I want to channel my thoughts. Have been using it daily for quite a time.
This app really helped me to soothen my mind and enlighten my mood. All the features work perfectly. Thanks!
"Amazing app. It has functions to follow your mood, draw pictures/attach pictures to your stories and a lot of motivation-based functions that really resonates with me. There's also a community if that is your thing. As a normal diary, I don't know how good it is, but as a therapeutical tool for managing emotions and thoughts; it's invaluable."
I love the app it makes me feel better about my self and it also makes me feel like I'm taking to a person
I don't like the app It takes much time to open
Good
One of the best app chiku raj
Loved
I wish I could rate is with zero stars. Such apathetic app
"I love this app! Thank you! I recommend it for sure, it helps to clear out my mind and keep my emotions and my mood healthily! 👍👍👍 I use it everyday, I take out special time to write down how my day was. Also the design is very good, and looks cute!"
So nice but if we could add diaries without network it was better.
Good
Its the best
"I like the app..has a nice ambience, the UI is really interactive and easy to understand, however I don't understand the concept of rating that is generated when you add a story..on what factors it is dependent..and how does it calculate the score..also no tutorial and guidance feature..UI rating 3.5/5, feature rating 3/5, overall I will rate this application as 3/5."
"I absolutely love Chiku. The daily tasks, the brilliant well-chosen quotes, and the whole mood log, which I use for further magnetizing of desired realities. I see changes already. Beyond how awesome the app is, it's so fun to use, the user experience is great and the support team (if you ever need them) are quick to respond and help."

Please allow the essential features for free such as lock. Also allow the ability to have backups And have sticky header or reminder And have these moods etc in the bottom of each entry letting person decide if he want to choose or not. And add adding other dates if missed.
"A really nice app. Would love a recording feature in the next upgrade, though."
