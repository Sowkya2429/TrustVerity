"Ad app, just littered with ads barely usable. Does not work from images"
"every action was followed by a an ad. I have ruler by xalpha lab on my other phone and it's free, free of ads, and totally accurate. not paying $4.99 to remove ads for an app that only has one function. 🤑"
Just ads after ads after ads and the B don't even do anything at all . Opened after downloading and ive watched over 6 ads and it doesn't work

Exlent your measurement aap
I prefer to measure in feet/yards. This app doesn't give that option. It's difficult to determine accuracy of the app in meters.
Rubbish
did not work at all
