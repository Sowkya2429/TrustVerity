"Looks like a cool app, however, not able to add anything to the journal or add my exercise. tried to find a manual or a help in case i was doing something wrong. nothing on the app. Frustrating as it would have been what i was looking for."
"The Ui is great but I can't find my friend in there by entering his username, he can't find me neither. Fix this problem please"
It's a perfect app exactly that I want
I'll give 5 stars only if you fix the lag otherwise great app
"Love this app, very nice ui very nice concept. Few suggestions - -Add to do list option, since it's a daily routine app, would be nice for me to see everything i have to do in one place. - should be able to edit older days.. sometimes i forget to check in and break my streak, that feels bad. Thankyou, otherwise lovely app"
"Just because it has a community, but I didn't like the app overall"
"Estou gostando bastante do app, est√° sendo um aux√≠lio na minha mudan√ßa de h√°bitos."
I am using this app from last 5-6 months. But I don't know why today it's not opening. If possible please suggest something
"The idea is interesting and the app looks asthetic, however after opening the app I had no idea on how to use it, after looking for five minutes I didn't find how I can log my habits or how in general I should use the app."
Great app for accountability.
Hey i am unable to login the app. is there anything wrong with app ?
"It's such a great app and it was working just fine,but now you guys logged me out and when i want to log back in i just can't and i don't know why!! I even uninstall it and reinstalled it but it's still not logging me back in and it literally have been 3 days now. L"
Not able to log in. Error reccuring from 3-5 days. Please look into the matter.
There is something wrong. I can't login using my Google account.
Since two days I am not able to log in to my account even I was logined before and I had lost all of my streak due to this stupid glitch
"Stopped being able to login, please fix!!!"
Just WOWüòç
"Could have the option to block profiles, I'm getting spam messages üôÑ :/"
The app is good. The only problem is it is full of bugs and very slow which makes it difficult to use. Please fix it and I'd be happy to update my review. Also it would be great to have a pause button for the habits.
"app is perfect, been using it for a while but i am experiencing bugs, like delay and freezing"
"Looking interesting so far with habit buddy concept. Only issue - Bad performance of app, literally the most resource intensive game runs smoother than this."
"Great, but unable to use offline at all"
"There are some bugs with the creation of habits and reminders, but overall, it's a good app."
Overall app concept is bestest of the best and it real have every feature which we wanted but the only problem I am facing is when we check in over habit ( we swipe right to check in) that time the app stuck in the place or freze and its not smooth like it should be so yeah hopping so that it get better and if it get better 5 star's obviously.
"I just saw that there is no review, so I will make one ! Very recent application, with a great concept, which mixes habits and social network. so you can see a progress and share it (or keep it private) ! I love the concept, I've been using it for almost a week. New features are being developed and are coming as we go along, it's very nice to see the application being built even more. Can't wait to see the new features !"
"Nice after update, it became much better respect. Keep going!"
"There are some issues I have found like through habit invites I can follow myself which is kind of a bug , app can be slow and a bit complex so was tricky to get friends to join and learn how to use it. Maybe a simple walk through when users first join would help ,it would he helpful to be able to create a tribe as a normal user with friends, also if you can add other options of habit check ins with a buddy besides photo, also if you'd forward check ins between users in chat for history."
"not able to sign in, my internet is working fine but when i click the sign in button or try to creat account using google, it just keeps loading and loading. i m stuck at the sign in screen since i downloaded the app. i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. not working. PLEASE FIX THIS edit : still not fixed"
So far so good. Will update.
This app does not have a good ux and I suggest kin instead.
This is what I needed for self development. I just loved it since I just signed in.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The best appp and Itsssss good freeeeeee And one more thing The Develepor is sooooo nice.
"Installed it twice but it just keeps loading forever. I'm stuck on the ""habits you'd like to build"" page"
"The app is perfect in terms of settings and design...but the only problem is that the app is kinda slow and stops for some moments in specific places. Add to that I wish that the developers add a widgets for it, this will givr a better performance"
I recommend this app for everyone to know and you should as well!
"It was working fine when I first downloaded it but when i tried to open the app for day 2, it logged me out and i can't log in. I even tried reinstalling the app and check the internet connection but nothing is working"
"Sir it's been 30 min , it's not loading the 1st page about selection of body habits , kindly help me ..."
Everything you NEED. is here
Enjoy sharing your new habits with others
"Just one day of using it and I can already tell it is an amazing habit tracker. Although, two things I wish the developers can take care of: First, support for high refresh rate. Scrolling through the app feels really sluggish. Secondly, please make a widget for quick glance of activities/habits"
"The concept of the app is great, it motivates when people like you being productive, it pushes us to do better. However, the app is lagging a lot, would love to see some free tribes too along with paid ones and some changes in the overall look of the app."
One of the best app but it will be perfect if it work offline and have a widget
A great app with great operator and community to build and stick with habits.
Great app! Makes you feel more productive and helps with building new habits
"I.m rating this app after using it for about 4-5 days. If you are sick of instagram, targeted ads and stuff like that this is the perfect app for you. Besides the easy to use interface, people are amazing, really helpful in achieving any of your goals and a big plus, i dont seem to have any battery issues. Really recommend this"
Really helpful with building a habit...
The best app
"Amazing app I love the update, it makes easy to navigate the app and all other features are so üëå"
"It is good,but why is the reminder isn't working?? I have set multiple reminder,but time passed and i can't get the reminderüôÑ"
"Honestly love this app, it has nearly everything I was looking for in a habit tracking app and even more. I love the welcoming and supportive community around it, also that it's add free! However one thing I would like in this app is the addition of one time tasks, which you could use as a check list perhaps"
quite swag
"EDIT2: It seems like it's working correctly now, thank you lots!"
"I did update the App, and now i can't use it, how is that possible?"
Best tracking app
"Easy to use, ad free, instant support system to answer all queries, accountability partners available, simple privacy settings, option to create custom habits, daily and timely reminders, color coded habit groups, quick and easy check in, visually appealing habit tracking chart, all in all the best habit tracker I have used so far!"
"Not working, only the ""identi"" logo on black screen and nothing happen..."
"I really liked the idea of this app, UI is perfect, but I get error signing into app, it keeps sending internal server error"
"Rubbish, doesn't work at all"
This app has an amazing user interface and is so far the best one I could find. It is amazing how much thought process has gone into making this and it reflects on the quality and features of the app.
How do you enter completion of tasks
I love this app! It has helped me alot so far. It's really nice and it gives you a sense of community which is really motivating
"In my opinion, the best part of this app is how there are other members who can hold each other accountable. I'd appreciate if there was a video explaining how to use the app, in addition to all the other videos. I had a bit of a struggle trying to figure out how to check in each of my habits. Maybe a clear delineation between the page where we check in and the settings for each habit may help."
Can't believe this is *for free!*
Its a good habit tracker. They actually reply and try to solve your problem if you have any. User interation of this app is also something to look upto.
"The app is unique in its social media aspect. You can see each other's habit check ins, captions and photos along with that. There are also tribes which is a paid feature that allows you to join a group headed by a coach. The part where it's lagging behind is statistics behind habit check ins and a lack of flexibility. You cant archive a custom habit. And if you forgot to check in Even though you did the habit, you will still lose streak. That's pretty off putting if I am going to use this."
"Really promising. I love the design. It has a interactive bubble that shows at the same time what areas of life I had already checked in a habit. There's a community too. The possibility of have an approver who checks if I really did that habit, there's the choice of influence others to keep motivated to just doing, and reach goals which makes the app social. But we have the choice of only followers to see it or keep it private. I recommend it. I suggest archiving habits or wish list them thnku"
I m not even able to sign up it's just showing fail to load habits Even though wifi speed is 42gbps. Resolve it pls ASAP
Great app!
I wish it had habit note
An amazing app with an amazing ui and really good features. Definitely recommend!
IDK HOW TO USE THIS PLS I JUST WANT TO USE IT BUT I DONT UNDERSTAND
Exactly what I've been looking for. But it needs to have a tutorial because it was confusing at first
This app really very good for everyone to improve yourself. Also wants some ui updates but the concept is really uncomparable.
I'm glad to say that the app is very good but there's a part missing and that part is you can't see people's posts in their personal profile. it will be a great thing if post they add in feed section saved in their profile and every one else can see it. Sorry for my English. üòÇüòÇ
Best 0f the best
Nice
An unstoppable app
"Its quite good, but its a little laggiesh even on high end phone."
I love the graphics üòçüòç‚úåüèªüå± amazing app to build a habit. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"RLY2 loved the unorthodox/non like the other app kind of ui design! BUTT what i rly got annoyed by was the fact that i accidentally clicked check ins. when i opne the app. (newber so. cant) üìåso i would suggest change the.. ux or whatever into not ez check-able? other than that i had to delete all the habits & Re add them again. 2 times now. what a frustration, thanks"
"This is the best app that encourages users to track ,analyse,connect,share and collaborate with like minded people and build long lasting habits and grow with a community...."
It's very helpful. I recommend it since I want to keep track of my habits and growing actions
Everything is great but can you please tell me how to add new habits.
Brilliant app to change life style
Keep on crashing
10/10
"This app is great. I mean its like something i was looking for, The only bug or glitch or problem was that if i set a reminder for any habit , its notification come only if the app is opened in the cache menu. If it is cleared from there , the notification does not comes. I hope that will be fixed soon.. Everything else i found was absolutely great.ü§óüëç"
"this is honesty THE APP i was looking for. minimalistic, simple, attractive and also my queries were solved so fast?? i was so surprised but in a pleasant way ofc lol. i would recommend anyone wanting to build habits this app. also it's honestly similar to other spcial media as u can also connect with others!! love it <3"
"The app is well organised and easy to use. But the most importantly it gives us strength and motivation to keep up with our routines, knowing other people can see our efforts to bild our healthy habits."
Amazing app love all the features... Would be amazing if you added widgets. Overall amazing app with lovely UI
Never imagined that a habit tracker could be THIS detailed and great. App is so well organised and if full of AMAZING features !
Great app
"The first habit app I like, please make animation smooth , otherwise great app!!!."
Concept is good. But i am having hard time adding if i did it and removing. Very hard to manage in app. I was scrolling and found i checked in two habits. Please simple UI for check in.
"What's there to say? It's a great app for a great concept! I do wish there's more customization to the reminder system though, for example this morning I just got a notification to study English (which I often do on weekends) while I'm riding the bike to work."
I will found out everything mjkobe
Amazing app Just 2 changes I want 1. The tribes should be free of cost so that anyone( including students who have no source of income or ppl wd financial issues) can join the tribes 2. There is a chatting option in this app but its hard to get in touch wd anyone if you r not in any tribe so plz do something abt it Otherwise this app is rly rlyyy Amazing
The best app!
This app will definitely reach 1 million downloads in no time .A wonderfulband innovative ui and had a smooth experience so far .But would be pleased if it also consists free tribes .
"UI is great but not much to write and keep track of your progess. I don't understand the application at all. Please create a video walkthrough of the app showing all functionalities, a tab with all resources and linking them to any video sharing platform (YouTube, Dailymotion etc). Hoping to see an update soon, will update the rating as well."
So far I really like this app! My friend and I were looking for something where we could hold each other accountable for keeping up with our habits and encourage each other on our progress and this is perfect for that.
"Small community so far, but phenomenal experience so far."
The Platform is a great way for people and especially creatives to grow and build themselves up and build a growing mindset!
"The app's great! I mean it's like something that i have been searching for. I suggestion though. Every time I press back, the app quits. And I have to open and wait until it loads. How do I add my own new habit?"
"Identi is like social media for people committed to self growth. I'm only 3 days into using the app so I won't say much. If you want to track your habits and stay motivated by other people's habit building portfolio, then Identi is the app for you. The UI is simple, neat, and easy to navigate. And if you're not sure how it all works there's a mini tutorial for every feature on the app."
"It is the best habit tracker I have tried so far. It is very user friendly and well thought through. It is very visual - giving you overview of all 4 categories as well as simplifying tracking the habits. I love that it has mentor and community options, so you don't feel alone and can be kept accountable."
"Super buggy, slow and I keep getting the message 'something went wrong' at the bottom of the screen"
"Amazing. I'm in love with the app and it's UI. It's just so engaging. I log my habits just to use the UI. There are a few changes required. For example, I am not able to log a weekly or a monthly habit, even though the option is available, it's getting tracked on a daily basis. And it would be nice if I can set the date of my weekly or monthly habit. The push notifications can have a quick log, where I don't need to open my app everytime to log it.. & the notification can have a good ui."
I can't sign in and I'm getting error
If you want to build new habits. Try this app. I'm very happy to use this app. It is really easy to use and helpful.
Hm the idea of the app is good but need some improvement. 1. Ease of deleting the account. 2. Ease of navigation. 3.adding the habits that was choosen in the first pages automatically to the app. 4. Removing unnecessary clutters. You can refer the Duolingo app and try follow such a format. Tribe/community is good but the main focus should always be ease of adding habits and less cluttered interface. Really loved the concept but yeah please consider these.
"At√© agora t√™m sido o melhor aplicativo do g√™nero dos milhares que testei nos √∫ltimos tr√™s anos. Todas as fun√ß√µes do App s√£o gratuitas (apenas se quiser fazer parte de uma das tribos h√° valores simb√≥licos por m√™s, mas √© totalmente opcional e n√£o influencia o uso do restante do App). √â poss√≠vel ver o progresso de pessoas ao redor do mundo ou de pessoas que voc√™ segue, bem como compartilhar o seu pr√≥prio com fotos e legendas."
I am Explorer black diamond üíé
Keep saying failed to load habits idk why But it seems promising
"Great app, good habit tracking and lots of options and habit to choose. You can share your record with people in app that will help you not lose focuse by reminding you. Support is very nice and has a quick response time. If you're have any issues they will try and fix it as soon as possible Overall, great app for tracking habits."
Good program.

"I found this app in an ad on Google play when I was searching for habit tracker apps. I have never seen or used an app like this, and at first I thought it was gonna be difficult to get used to habit trackers. But this app's community tribes and interactive design made me change my mind completely. It's such a great app and I actually get things done unlike with others apps I have tried! üëç"
Love this app...gives me the motivation to do it!
This app is very useful to tracker our habit.
"Really interested in this concept, can't give out a full scale review now as I'm only couple of days in to this app. But so far, I like this minimal design and usage. I'll update this review over time. Really appreciate devs effort ‚ù§Ô∏è hope this gets to millions!"
The only feature it lack is habita on exact days of week. Currently if I set a habit for once a week it shows on all days and if I dont mark it as complete it feels I haven't done everything.
"To be very honsest, as an App developer, i can say that you guys put your best, and app's functionalities are awesome, but as an user, i will say that ux of your app is not good. may you get Success."
How to add a new habit after establishing the routine you suggested?
"Very new but I am actually enjoying using it. It really keeps one motivated just by the simple fact of seeing other like-minded people achieving success in completing their ""habits"". There is much more to this app, it connects you to other users and there are tribes hosted by qualified professionals who know their stuff. Well done on developing such a powerful app."
"It looks good so far, but I don't know how to use it..."
"Pretty unique compared to the rest on the market. The rainbow gradient thing & the whole ui in general is pretty satisfyingly clean. It was quite easy to setup too & having the habits split into categories, each with a different colour scheme was pretty cool. my only concern is that the app seems to be more community focused. more bad habits would be cool tho. and also streaks starting from the last relapse. also an optional support dev botton since the app is ad-free"
"It's a really cool app, I suggest adding desktop widget to show the streaks or toggle task progress. It makes habit tracking way easier."
It's one of the best apps for building up new and productive habits . I've been using it for the past week and I haven't came across any problem . The people behind this app respond to my queries and I would recommend anyone who wants to build up habits or trying to improve in their daily life should give identi a try ...
i can not sign up with my google account. whats the reason?
Very useful to build and fix good habits
"Identi, driving social media into a new productive concept! Reminding us how minor things we neglect, and take for granted! And how important they are! Very well done, Maurice and his team!"
I LOVE IT.
Looks good feels good but takes a millenia to load. I couldn't even sign up! Phone: Oppo A9 2020 72Mbps internet Logged in to Google
"This app is such a great idea, and look forward to helping implement it."
The best habit tracker app. I really love the design. The ability to have an approver is a great idea. It helps me to do my habits continually. There's a bug related to tribe that every time it goes to chat directly. Other than that it's almost stable.
The idea behind the app is really nice:) I have been trying like many habit trackers in the past. But This app is a novel experience. I have one suggestion that please include a way to add categories.
The best habit tracker out there! And I'm not only saying this because I'm the CTO üòú
Promising but some bugs. Happybto share it with you.
