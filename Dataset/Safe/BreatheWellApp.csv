Breathwell is a bogus. They took money from me and no service. I do not recommend anyone to join breathe well.
Not able to get otp to proceed
Very easy to use and highly informative of your daily activities
No proper communication.
I have joined in this programme just 14 days back. While joining my FBS readings are varying in between 150 and 175. Now my FBS readings are varying in between 98 and 79. My insulin dosage also reduced from 14 units to 10 units. Really I feel it is amiracle. My health coach Udaya kumari efforts are so much appreciable in my journey. She is taking care of all my needs in this journey. I am very much thankful to her. With her support I can set new goals and try to reach them.
A complete Team work with Great Aim

"A very nice app to manage and monitor your all diabetes related activities, whether it's exercise, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks or health coach and doctor consultation. Everything at one place and very easy to update and monitor improvements."
Good üëç
"I personally won't recommend to go after BWB to anybody, they follow more or less same line of therapy of allopathy. Rather you should go for alternative indigenous therapies for your diabetes management."
Nice platform for diabetis reversal
They will immediately stop access to your prescriptions if you choose not to renew their plan. They will also not share the prescriptions offline even if you need them. I am not sure if legally they are allowed to stop access to prescriptions. Will explore these options now
"Very good for diabetes management n reversal, with good nutrition advice, fitness coach, educational videos on diet, recipes, exercises,live n recorded yoga sessions. If followed one can reverse diabetes."
Excellent
It's a very good mentorship for individual to attain a medicineless and diabetes less life style.
"Very good, you may opt for your betterment."
I want to get my refund. They forced me to join for diabetic reversal program and took 11900 rs. I paid yesterday. It was my big mistake. I wanted to get my refund but no one is helping me. I didn't take any service till now. Pls refund my hard earned money. I have paid yesterday.
I enjoyed the journey and filled my life with joi.üíêüíêüôèüôè

"I wasn't happy with the services and wanted to opt out, also i have been following up for months on this issue and not getting a response."
Initial start was very good but the coaches are bad due to leave etc they don't bother to take calls etc. All my good initial experience ilhas tourned very sour. I am a high diabetic and because of them i am now having sugar fluctuations. This is a human error app etc is very good even doc's are good. If they don't keep professional and good coaches they are doomed. The last coach said she was busy due to Ramzaan. God help me.
Help to reduce sugar level effectively
"Good support from my coach Asha Rani motivates every time, advice the right spirit."
"Ms. Diyya Saluja is so perfect and excellent. Above all, she is nicest human being. Everyone should be like her"
Excellent follow up Excellent food suggestions with availability of links
It's good app and program itself.Committed to achieve goal in coming months.Its mainly the human touch that will push you to success.I would like express my sincere thanks to my health coach Miss Gargi Sareen who is amazing and keeps me motivated.
Most unethical team. Don't waste your money.
Pretty easy to use n promot response in case of any issues. Great support from the team in the program.
"I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IF I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REGAINING MY HEALTH IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF MY COACH MS. MANISHA SHARMA ...WHO GUIDED , HELPED AND ENCOURAGED ME TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL....THANKU MAAM WITHOUT YOUR PATIENT GUIDANCE I COULD NEVER HAD BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE MY CONDITION...THANK YOU"
Very good systematic sop will enable to meet the goals of individuals to weight loss or Diabetes reversal. If one follows this system definitely successful will be visible to oneself.

I am extremely happy with Breathe well being app and team. By following their advice my medicines reduced by 75% in a month. App and their monitoring and handholding is awesome and wonderful. My heartfelt gratitude to team BWB specially my health coach Ms. Vasudha and yoga coach Ms. Reetu Chauhan. I believe the fee they charge is meager compared to their continued mentoring and services. I am enjoying my pleasant journey of diabetes management/reversal with BWB
One of the best apps

Excellent App to Track your Calories and get health tip from expert.
A team of professionals working towards zero diabetes through reversal process
Be careful as they will make you pay full payment and once done will only assign someone for follow up but never bothers if all services are provided. Don't get cheated......
Good
Unable to sign up no code received mobile number tried many times in a week now un installed that's the only solution üòÄ
Very effective
Such a well made app. A lot of attention and detail has been put into this a lot of effort. The calorie tracking is such a nice feature for example- it has variety of foods and u can control even the portion. The recipe page has tons of recipes. U can see ur bgl and weight trend as well. Only thing which bothers me is they can improve UX a bit as well as those irritating prompts where u have to rate your healt coach/ fitness/ doctor consultation. Like everytime is a bit much. I skip everytime.
Excellent
"I had a very bad experience with this company. First of all the app was not working and i did not get support for that for days. Second, this is not for those who hate restrictive regimens with no positive feedback. All they did was criticise. Third, they did not give my refund and tried to talk me out of it despite asking them to cancel my account. They'll sell it on the sales call but I've not yet received my refund. Avoid this company. There are better programs out there."
This is the best app for the reversal journey of diabetics
Feeling very normal now. Hope ful to get rid of this sugar issue with the help of Breath Well Being.

Doctors keep on changing on monthly basis which creates lot of confusion. The quality of doctor seems degraded over time. Doctors often misses the consulting call without prior informing.

No details appear in the app after login despite paying Rs 100. No ID password are sent for zoom. Seems high level fraud.

BWB is an extraordinary organization where controlling diabetes type 2 and body weight is very easy and simple. In one month I have reduced 2.5 kg weight and my diabetes level has come come down effectively. I love BWB for joining me.
App sometime having performance issues which is not major that get resolved instantly. The Program is very beneficial and they took individual care to ensure people subscribed to the program are comfortable throughout till reversal. It's better than other organisations running similar program. Nutrition specialist are aware of how to change the individual habits and adapt to the better lifestyle. Doctors are also good. Recommend to join the program without hesitation .
Good services

Fake app. Dont trust them. They just loot money from you and then no response nothing. Attracting customers with Rs 100 trick and then no calls no text nothing. Like this how much 100's have been sent to them by various customers. They are Fraudsters.
It is just awesome app . without thinking anything just go for it.it just transforms it

Excellent app
Nice apps
Very useful for someone working in corporate and has less access towards wellness may be due to time or any other factor. Good work team Breathe well being.
Sync is not proper and fast ..Everytime refresh button to be pressed
App does not update steps
Good step towards fitness
Very bad ux
"Somehow these guys got my phone number and sent me an SMS to download the 
app. I don't need to lose any weight. No need to send any SMSes guys. 
Respect people's privacies."
It's very nice and joy full
Bug step not counted
"After opening aapplication, always open feedback page and it is pathetic...."
No option for sign up. No response when called on Support contact provided.
Need some improvement like add and delete by team member
"Need more interactive UI. Synchronisation of steps to be made automatic 
instead of manual synk."
Very helpful..
ok

Awesome app.
A truly helpful app helped in telling the required calorie to intake..
Step race is the most interesting thing.  Provided by company but I think it should be for everyone
Nice app.
Great app
Useless. Everyday app updation required
Step count deduction
Really a frustrating app. Did not synchronize well with google fit & works well only with some specific models like i-phone
Disgusting  app
Updation problem
Seriously waht a faduu app. Never seen such a rime waste app.
There had been lot of instances from last 2-3 days wherein the steps shown in google fir and in your app does not match even after sync operation. Also dont you have any support team for solving any queries or its just an facelift.app which gets everything done from google fit???
One of the most disgusting app ever seen... Steps never get updated by linking Google fit app
Nice App
Gr8
Doesn't work

Keeping every step into account. Nice.
Not getting the sign up option Directly showing the Login option
Getting in the habit of walking every day. Kudos
Loved it. Love you bro. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Cool to use.  Loved it!
"Very addicting, step-on !!!"
Now the app is working perfectly.....let's step-a-thon cheers !!!
Apps crashing every time I try to open.. Fix it
Not working.. taking tooooo much time to load
The App is crashing as soon I am opening it on one plus 3 device
"App is crashing every now and then. If by chance it does not crash, then only one feature can be seen at once and then for the next feature I need to exit the app. Lastly, there are various fitness band in the market now and we have just 2 bands to connect in the app, need to increase the stock in this regard. Major overhaul required."
Too slow and crashing as we change the tab..
I don't see why do you need access to my media or phone !!! There is absolutely no requirement logically to access images or phone contacts/messages for any apps ability to count steps or provide notifications.
