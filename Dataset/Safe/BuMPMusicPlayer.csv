0,Realized developer updated this app last in 2015. This app was an amazing discovery very easy for multi tasking. If developer is still alive somewhere thank you for this one.
1,I wish floating window acts like some kind of a banner for the mp3. The song name only appears briefly and after changing tracks. And the function to put some delays after a song would be nice too. Bump it to 5 stars when it happens.
2,Can not login spotify premium please Update
3,Not working in Android 12
4,This App Is Brilliant. Easy To Use With The Menu Tabs.A Small Widget Icon Is On The Home Screen To Make It Easier To Access. I Choose This One Because The Default Player Was Removed.
5,Not working android 11 version ᥬ🥺᭄ update plz ᥬ🤬᭄
6,"I was looking for an app like this ever since I saw Youtube music's overlay when opening audio files with it, except this is way better since you can make it the default audio player and whenever you try to open an audio file a bubble pops up and audio starts playing! This is an awesome app all around, only downside is that when you play an audio you can't swipe to skip, and when you play something it doesn't show other audio files in the same folder when clicking the bubble."

8,Used it on an older phone but will not work now
9,Gifi
10,"PLEASE DO SOME UPDATES, THIS APP IS AWESOME ❤️"
11,Vhi
12,Mm
13,This app always crash everytime when i am trying to play spotify premium music.
14,"pop out button is awesome, but you can't seek the track"
15,عالیه بنصبید
16,Well the app is unique as a pop out bubble music player is useful in many ways. 9.8/10 But the app closes crashes oftens. And the app needs some improvement in feature
17,Best floating music player
18,Nice
19,Well okay then 🙄🙄🙄🙄
20,It's amazing
21,This is the most useful app out there! Needs an updat tho. It doesn't work on android 10 devices... Anyways an update would be awesome!
22,app Crash when adding music to shuttle list in Android 10 ✔︎
23,Nice
24,"Queue list is suck, this app only using same queue not changing"
25,Has good sound quality and would be better with equalizer
26,It's nice but atleast you can jump to part of the music. It just started in the beginning.
27,Great app really useful
28,"Doesn't work with podcasts! - Logs into my account, sees my playlists, doesn't do anything else at all. Nothing makes it start playing. I clicked the play button dozens of times and tapped the playlist names and anything else you could possibly do and this fake app just sits there doing nothing. What a joke. EDIT: apparently the problem is that i'm trying to play podcasts with it. Even though i put my podcasts into a spotify playlist, they won't play through the music player. Epic failure."
29,Some bugs but its okey HAHAHAH plssss update more
30,damn app won't work on my phone qhy is it can anybody ans!??
31,Superb app
32,One of a kind music player on the Playstore. Lightweight and simple. Perfect! A suggestion would be to make the playlist window resizable. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍
33,Open nahi ho rha he
34,"Nice floating music player , but should be designed to integrate other music players like power amp, neutron player, etc"
35,"We need an update for this app. Its too old that it cannot support new gen devices well. It will crash everytime we remove a song from the playlist, as well as adding a new song. Its really annoying. Please fix this."
36,Good floating player 😍😍😍
37,"It's a great app. But, have a lot crashes. I couldn't enjoy using it."
38,Unable open android 8
39,very bad
40,Its really helpful app thankyou BuMp Music Player
41,Terrible. It crashes all the time. Waste of time and space. Don't install it.
42,Please add theme to this app
43,"For those who can't even open the application, go to app settings and enable both Display Pop Up Window settings. Pretty decent media player, suits my HUD Car. Thank you dev."
44,Crashes a lot
45,"Doesn't work on Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, it doesn't even open."
46,"Muchos bugs, se crashea cada vez que le pico al botón ""+"", y cuando reproduzco cualquier canción. Y aparte no encuentra playlist ni locales ni de Spotify"
47,Beautiful
48,awesome....
49,Didn't even boot
50,Good idea design. Can the float button add play/pause function?
51,Helpful
52,"good idea, but misses a lot of needed basic options, even the sort by genre option which is common is not present.."
53,need an update its 2019 cuzz.. work it
54,😅
55,please add new theme / amoled theme
56,perfect nough said
57,App sucks ass
58,nice bro
59,this has been pretty decent so far although it is a bit simple
60,Still guessing.
61,Awesome app
62,cant even log into spotify via Facebook. asks for user/pass which is stupid and defeats the point! fails to log in no matter what. trash.
63,Love it. Had been using it 3years now
64,"Everything thing is awesome but missing some basic features like making playlist, adding tracks to favorite playlist, recently added and recently played playlist are missing...and main thing there should be a gesture or notification bar button to start this bump head every time opening the bump setting is annoying 😑"
65,"Good app but it could be great if it can be connected with spotify offline mode and even when online, songs can not be skip which forces you to take your phone out of your pocket just to skip a song, that's extremely annoying. fix that and you'll become the undisputed king."
66,"Last update: Oct 6, 2015"
67,"Great when playing games the app is floating on top, but please add a tab to make a Playlist that u can save so u don't have to add music all over again it's very frustrating.please make a new update"
68,Awesome !!!!!😍
69,Wow great app just not liking the new update i can no longer move songs within my playlist i have to start over adding songs to rearrange them and that sucks ..also where's my spotify
70,nice 👍👍👍
71,"Great app, light weight, great design"
72,"Lovely app, too bad it doesn't support Deezer."
73,Thnx to developers....... Best app
74,Pls make line like in real music player to adjust the song
75,Please support tidal!
76,",💗💙💚💛💜💢💝💞💟❣️"
77,This app not open
78,"Work well, suggest equalizer"
79,Force closes on emui 3.1 every time you try to play anything so can't give it more than 1 star.
80,"Can't get into settings, no option. Can't unlink my Spotify account"
81,I can't play my playlists through Spotify with this app.
82,"Wouldn't work with Spotify Premium. Think it's more to do with not being able to press ""access"" due to new security measures on android but still couldn't use it"
83,"""BRILLIANT"" And that's no lie, enough said.....PEACE!"
84,"Five stars ,we need more options like equalizer and sort music by folders .......keep upgrading"
85,wonderful style
86,I love the concept.. but the only feature I'm missing.. infact everyone out there would be missing is the ability to control music through earphone buttons.. I mean in normal players.. we can skip to next song by double clicking the earphone button. But using this app .. we can just pause and play but not switching to next track .. please add that feature ASAP
87,Nice music player.
88,Needs to add the playlist that i downloaded
89,Please add a bar to touch and choose position from where we can listen song
90,Would better if....... blacklist folders and floating configuration like transparency and option toh hide it becas its disturbing while playing games .... As opinion
91,"Add search bar below or atleast an option, this is a deal breaker for me"
92,Amazing app use it all the time and very fluent
93,Great! Just add a function to decrease the size of the bubble
94,Add equalizer in the app
95,Cool player
96,NO USB DAC SUPPORT!
97,This app is exactly what I was looking for. Its like the messenger bubbles but for music. It works surprisingly well no lag.👍
98,"This app ask for caller ID permissions, so it seems that he is most likely malicious and will sell your data."
99,It's very simple
100,floating app...I like it very much
101,Luv it
102,Unable to find playlists. Quits without playing song. Musixmatch is a better alternative.
103,I cant set ringtones... Or delete songs .....
104,Dope concept. It freaks out a bit when I go to my recent apps. Needs soundcloud support! Add that and you'll have 5 stars from me
105,I can't seek a song in this app
106,Deberian dejar que la informacion de cada tema musical sea permanente y no que solo se muestre al principio de cada tema musical en la pantalla del dispositivo porfavor dejen la informacion de cada musica permanente en la pantalla eso le daria un plus extra a la app.
107,I wish that it could use free spotify accounts. Then I would use it.
108,"OH MY GOD THIS IS THE APP IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR THE LONGEST, it automatically puts all my music into playlists instead of me having to do it manually one by one in Play Music. This app makes listening to music soooo easy!!Thank you!!"
109,"I have a problem, the music source above does not let me switch to the playlist filter, it works with songs, albums, artists, etc, but switched on Playlists it says there are no results​... Am i doing something wrong?"
110,I think song info panel should have show-hide button so that we can switch to bump or panel
111,It's a good app and does the job pretty well
112,Update Please! Been waiting too long.
113,Best for...time pass
114,The app is really good but the bad thing is that you need connection to listen to Spotify music even if you have Spotify premium
115,Nice player work nice with spotify thanks
116,"BRING BACK BUMP PLAYER!! I dont know why dev gave up on this wonderful little app. Bring it back, it's a life saver!"
117,Love it?!but please add more themes.atleast a dark theme would be nice.Also add a search function to search for the song we want to play
118,Thanks
119,Love the app! Anyway for a Apple music plugin
120,Nice effort but lacks navigation options
121,"I'm still getting used to the floating music button, but the fact that this is so fast and lightweight makes it worth a download imo. Spotify integration especially, since this opens and plays an album in like two seconds compared to minutes to open and load an album on the spotify app. The only problem I have with this app is that I would like playlists to also appear if possible."
122,Wow
123,Love it
124,well. nice one😑😌
125,"Nice app, i just love it. Waiting for next upcoming features.."
126,Loved this app. But it'll be better if its contains sleep timer
127,Could you add sleep timer please.
128,"Can you please add a ""folder select""! It's the only thing missing in this app"
129,"I would have liked it if you could have your playlist combined with your local songs and Spotify songs, you have to choose between the two"
130,"You guys have amazing ideas.  However, the floating button is intrusive when doing stuff and unfortunately, taking it off the screen kills the music. I think it should hide in the notification panel as a low priority notification just in case"
131,"can't fast forward, it just jumps back and forth a few seconds.. /: other than that, this is GREAT!"
132,really helpful. need more changes like floating icon size changer. and music navigation bar.
133,Nice
134,This is the one I was looking for.......but can you people make the widget detect stock player's playlists on MIUI? Fix it & I will give 5 stars....
135,I was gonna write about a few things about this app but realized it didn't get any updates since October 2015. Assuming it is abandoned.
136,Just Wow !!! just bring customization option...
137,Can't find my Spotify playlists.  Also the ability to make new playlists would be a plus.
138,Pls add volume control
139,Its ok
140,Why you installed 2 application?  1 widget 1 setting and why you not make just 1 application installed?????
141,"I would really like to have my previously made playlists to show up instead of going through the trouble of redoing them.  Other than that, it's amazing."
142,Simple and Humble!!
143,"This is one of the best music player but, it would be awesome if more settings. Like you can make the floating icon smaller or have the best equalizer😜. And you can change the back ground cover, this is the lightest music player that i ever downloaded so keep up the good work.😀😁"
144,"Minimalist Design, light and straight forward, but how do i get songs into favorite tab?"
145,"App is unable to play any file selected from folders. Includes mp3, ogg, wav files. Only plays songs selected in-app, damaging usability"
146,Please add an equalizer to the music player.
147,"Great floating app (widget )...but when some music are added to queue like 4 music are in queue now ...after playing the all 4 music's ,when I keep repeat all enabled then only last music will be played ...?"
148,Still a great app! But could you add apple music support too?  I love the low footprint and functionality!
149,First app to introduce this feature... Really very useful👍👍👍
150,cofusing while playing music plz make it simple i can't play what i wanted to play. u can give option of playlist
151,Music player is very nice to see
152,Holy cow thanx for this app.
153,Need support mp4 as music
154,Well 5 stars for quick reply and an awesome app.  It's sad that they don't have a google play API
155,"You need to add a seek bar too, its very essential! Rest newest concept and light and material design! LOVED IT, Just take care of that you'll be one of the best music players."
156,"I don't really get the advantage of this floating button. I can access the most important options of every other player within the notification drop down panel. So this is two interactions, just like with the floating button. This may be more subjective, but for me, this is rather disturbing to have the button everywhere. It didn't get me a wow effect - but for some all-day music listeners it may be helpful."
157,Good work. Thx
158,"Linked to Spotify Premium but can't display music by album artist, only album name. Bit of a basic thing to be missing."
159,I loved it very much
160,"I'm not able to manually select a music location. As such, the app does not see my music stored on my SD card. So it's unfortunately useless to me, which is a shame."
161,Wow
162,Little buggy with use over time.. Update needed
163,"I was amazed by the Spotify support, I mean that's my main purpose to have looked and found this app. But I noticed that it will only ""stream"" your spotify songs. Would it be possible to play the local songs saved through Spotify so that I can listen even my data is turned off or I choose to listen offline."
164,There's really nothing quite like BuMP. Strongly recommend. :)
165,"Never thought a floating music player could be so convenient. Only problem for me is closing the dropdown. Instead of reaching all the way to the top, maybe do like a swipe up to close like Facebook Messenger or perhaps a dropup."
166,"Amazing app ! Only one issue. Sometimes when you want to exit the application, the floating bubble goes but the notification control remains there ! Have to force stop the app in order to remove it.. otherwise amazing app !"
167,A music player that won't let me skip tracks. Uninstalled!
168,"This is what I was looking for! A very simple, lightweight music PLAYER, no need for all that extra bumph when all I want to do is play my music - thanks n7!!"
169,I love the simplicity it offers! Would be more happy if it include the option to exclude folder and also folder view!
170,"I love this, this app really awesome and way ez to use it"
171,Cool simple app
172,Nice one guys
173,Need improvement when i select all song then album they both are select and only show all songs plz fix but player is awesome
174,Such a great player. What I've been looking for for a long time. 👍
175,Stable than before
176,:(
177,"Simple, quick and easy to use. A very convenient app, and I'm even using it on my old phone..app doesn't require / consumes a lot of RAM.  would be nice though to add a ""Last Added"" feature when searching."
178,Always crashing when you select new song from Spotify source.... Please fix thiss
179,"This is great! Haven't used it too in depth at all yet but I'm sure I'll like it and it's a five for me just because you guys took the time and effort to make something so well thought out and designed, I'm sure so many people (myself included) were super excited to stumble upon this little gem. Thanks a lot!"
180,"Its a good application. There is innovation and creativity. The design its good. There's is only a bummer though. This application doesn't support any other streaming sources other than Spotify. I can say that Spotify it's great! But there are others. It's lightweight, just like you guys said, but I think that a few more KBS wouldn't make anyone angry as long as it pleases the users."
181,"The notification remains even after I paused the music for a long time, it needs to be swipeable"
182,BBM cannot open this file
183,STILL - no dark theme. Ouch. No update since October 2015. Heartbreaking.
184,I want to see more improvements in this player. Love
185,"Floating music app, my music, and Spotify; Well done!😄"
186,"Works perfectly. Great for apps that hate being minimized, such as fullscreen games."
187,but still not updated...waiting for update
188,crash
189,"the only way I get my music to play is if I buy spotify premium. I don't have the money for it,  so how can I access my regular spotify music???????  Help needed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks"
190,Crashes
191,Really good one
192,"It is the best I'd definitely recommend it, only I would give it the full five stars if it had a night mode and if you guys moved the play/pause/skip controls to the bottom of music pop up pannal, other than that this app is exceptional. Thank you for this app"
193,Could ull just give it a dark theme? White looks ugly
194,Only reason I downloaded it cause I have spotify but you have stream the music! What's the point if I have the songs downloaded on my phone already
195,But with the option to only play music and have no equaliser/set as ringtone etc is deal breaker but credit to being different.
196,Eagerly waiting for an update with more improvements. Things to change.
197,Minimalistic ui and awesome playback experience....
198,"It is good, but I only use deezer premium, if you add support to deezer that would be great and I will give you the 5 stars.👌"
199,Not working well update it
200,I love it
201,This is what I was looking for a long time. Good for multitasking purposes. Please add a play all option to get the best out of it and add an option to delete unwanted songs
202,"Brilliant app, very creative. Will be perfect if the song playing shows up when you open the playlist"
203,Love the app so much
204,Equaliser and playlist. İt will be more excellent with these. And other functions may make it perfect too. Please do these. Thanks anyway for this great player
205,Where is the seek bar or navigation..... How to seek music?
206,Need more frequent updates
207,Great features and design but needs an equalizer to make it greater.
208,"Liked the floating disc the most about it. But needs something more to be a good local player, : sleep timer, folder play, play next... No issue with the simple UI. Go on !🔝"
209,"Light, easy, beautiful with great eq. The music sounds  great when played on speaker."
210,"Cant play downloaded songs on spotify offline ,and why does the letters are all in capslock?"
211,:)
212,"It is a convenient player.  My favorite is still their n7player,  but this is a unique player"
213,Thanks for developer
214,"-1 star for the lack of equalizer and no ""Recently Added"" playlist."
215,"Then why 4 stars 😡.ok there is a one big problem.this player need lock screen control option to skip,backword,pause music from lock screen.that's all. Please add that option. Good luck !"
216,It would be better if u added a few more color options or themes..
217,The app is great as a whole but there are no lock screen music controls for android 4.2.2. I have to open my lockscreen everytime I want to change the song..
218,Equalizer Support isn't  there
219,Sooo...good
220,Nice UI! Good idea. A bubble music player :) pls add equalizer and bass enhancement setting for more quality sound output. Then ill stick to your app.  Keep it up!
221,Add Deezer support
222,"Absolutely love the app, it's lightweight, fast and to-the-point, but please add the feature to remove multiple songs from the queue rather than swiping each one."
223,"Amazing player, no playing errors, the only problem I have is that when I close the player, it comes back again. Or when I pause it sometimes, it restarts clearing the play queue and the time of the song I remained at. Please fix!"
224,It should only put the on screen widget when headphones are plugged in that should be a setting
225,Ok.... This a good concept great design and connects to spotify premium but it kinda lacks on how to remove a song on the list there is some option you can swipe it to the right to remove it but it is hard to remove all the songs one by one please create a easy removable song.... Tnx
226,Great n simple
227,"I would love to help you guys. So, it appears that bubble feature is kind of annoying. When I want to read on Play Book, Wattpad, or something like that. There is no way to hide the ballon or making option, not to be snapped to edge of the screen, so users can place the bubble as they want and can read/see something like in full-screen mode (the bubble should not be in they way). I hope this input will help you to create this app so useful. I forgot one thing. Maybe there is should be playlist editor."
228,Didn't know spotifys API allowed stuff like this
229,"amazing quality, definately in the top 5 best music players ive ever used"
230,Spotify player is rubbish on my Lenovo android. BuMP player sorts through all their crap and lets me play my playlists beautifully. Thank you N7!!
231,This is the music player I have been searching for. The bubble idea is very good. Just one feature request - If you could add folder option it would be best player😀
232,Awesome music player
233,خوبه
234,superb
235,"This thing rocks when you want to multitask, this player floats on top to make it happen. If you want to play a game or check e-mail while you listen this is the player for you. It sits on top of everything else, just like a pinned window on Linux. The floating circle is small enough that your view is only minimally obstructed. If it is covering an area you need to view, it can easily be dragged out of the way. A must have for all phones."
236,A Floater :)
237,Great work there
238,"Had problems with Spotify pausing when switching apps, this solved it! Just wondering when you play a playlist that's downloaded to my phone in Spotify, does it stream or play off the downloaded copy. Cheers!"
239,nice
240,Wow service
241,Please add skin in player theme
242,Awsme app for playing music but can you make app like this for playing videos
243,Won't open at all...
244,Awesome popup music control but I think it would be so much better with several different & customizable themes/Skins.
245,"The app is undoubtedly great....is very useful too..but the app should contains it's settings option inside the app itself, rather than having other icon for the settings in the menu..."
246,Good
247,Any chance of adding Deezer?
248,How to fastforward or skip parts of a song?
249,Wonderful
250,I like the way it's coded: no running services when not in use.
251,Great app... Just one problem... Add timer you guys
252,"The overall design is amazing, but had to erase it for not supporting non-premium Spotify. Also it is missing music sources."
253,"Hate having to go to my phone, It shows the music playing and all the toggles, but upon clicking nothing ever seems to happen when trying to pause, music up, ect...on the watch...but yeah the app itself is beautiful and functional but its 2015...""Me personally"" I'd be taking a step backwards just by using this player though...wear support is needed."
254,ممنون
255,IF YOU'RE A GEEK! DOWNLOAD. LOW END USERS DON'T!
256,Amazing ..  Simply on point 👌
257,It's very nice application for music .. for the music lover must be of this application... if you can add folder view than it's will better
258,Awesomest app :)
259,"It's a great idea for a music app, but it's not meant for me. It's great if you wanna manage music on one screen while doing something else, but can be a hindrance for full screen such as games."
260,"All around a great app,  support for Play music and sound cloud would be great"
261,Awesome.....plz keep updating more features
262,What this app needs is Google play music support
263,This one truly is an amazing app! Now I don't have to swipe down notification panel just to skip to a song. This app deserves a 5 star rating from every Android device user. Is there anyway to save playlist?
264,Lovely app but its blinding me with that white backdrop. Dark theme would be necessary for this to become a daily driver despite the float. My eyes just can't stand it otherwise.
265,خوب عالی متفاوت با همیه خوبیها
266,Really good idea.                           Keep thikinng more
267,Heard about this on Android App Arena. This an amazing free app.
268,best concept but can be more easy to browse
269,"A few little things that bugged me:  There could be more options in settings. I haven't found a way to toggle the widget on and off easily. Since I moved the widget to a new location, it is attracted too far off the screen, covering ~1/3 of the circle. It could also have an option to enable a lock screen to pause or skip songs. This has already nearly replaced my music player, and I'm really exited to see the future of this app."
270,"I do like what's available so far.  It's still lacking a few basic features like metadata editing, option to delete albums/folders, etc I will follow the development of this app."
271,Too much simple
272,Great app but its draining my battery largely
273,Dont ever stop working on this app. Love it ❤ just make it more stable
274,I really like it because of the spotify support but some album art are missing and the songs are not listed in alphabet order. Please fix this dev.
275,No updates?
276,If only it supports more services..
277,i love it
278,It would be really cool if it had an equalizer
279,Awesome app
280,Thanks for this app just perfect
281,I want musixmatch plugin to work as well
282,"The bubble is only half visible, the rest hides on the side, whenever i change the position of bubble"
283,An option to rescan for music would be really useful since the only option for me is to restart my device and also which folders to search for music.
284,"The concept of it amazing. The fluidity, the amount of multitasking it allows. God."
285,Really like the uniqueness about this player. Thank you
286,Great Idea! But need some optimizations
287,can you make a widget like this and can work in any music app just like the Dashdow Music please...
288,Hope you add lockscreen controls and theme color. I really want to have it black. Also could you have an option to always show track info? Instead of just showing it when track changes? That would be cool. Also sometimes it displays the wrong album art.
289,Sometimes it doesn't go away from the notifications even after closing the bubble. I hope you solve this bug in the next release. New bug: I cant play some tracks.
290,"excellent concept with great execution. however it needs WAY more features for it to replace my current music player. please add editing features, the ability to make playlists, sort queue etc."
291,I plays song but please provide a song search Drop down as well. Some times user wants to listen to specific songs.
292,Awesome idea
293,The interface is just awful.
294,One big suggestion for me is Google play music streaming support that's all I normally use for my music.
295,Awesome idea but would be better if it can be linked with n7 player so that we can use equaliser for our interest !!
296,Awesome concept! Loving it so far. :D
297,"This is the only music player I use and kicks the competition right where it hurts the most! Floating tunes on every screen, beautiful design, and functions much better then any other floating music player. However I have one small issue. The default album art (for songs with no album art) looks disgusting on my lock screen. An option to disable lock screen album art, would be greatly appreciated."
298,Add a volume slider and seekbar
299,Im here to give suggestions to make this even better... Okay so the only other really good music player that i have used is pixel player because of personalization...alll the other apps on this store look nasty.. Like.. The buttons and such .. And you couldnt change the colors and the themes were the same thing... Itd be cool if you guys do a thing where you we pay 4 dollars and we can get all the theme updates and colors for what we paid... You guys can have the bubble in a star shape or a skull i guess
300,It's perfect to me. Hope it doesn't change.
301,"Just a nice and peculiar music player, best in its own way. Just one feature request. Please add fader and gapless play back option. Thanks."
302,واقعا مزخرفه نزارید با این برنامه گذاشتنتون
303,"Without gapless playback, how can this be considered anything but a beta product? Certainly wouldn't pay for it without such a basic feature."
304,Very good app
305,Nic
306,"Love it so far! So lightweight and quick. Just some suggestions and bugs.  1) The ability to set starting position.  2) Standard practice for music apps during song playback when the back track button is pressed is to restart the song but this app skips back to the previous song. If I want to start the song over from the beginning, I have to now click both back and forward which seems like extra work for something that happens more often than wanting to return to the previous track.  3) The song title and a"
307,Must have light weight music player..! Nice interface with all basic requirements!
308,"Enjoyed the Messenger-like style, done well and smoothly. Extremely lightweight. No lock screen mode is a drawback though"
309,Really nice nice nice apppp....... like messenger style..i.will shure it.......please i have idea to devlop this app..1- add selection music by files ..2.add play music from when i stop  music and close the app..not from the beggening of the song...
310,Easy and smooth ☺
311,"Please consider adding support for Indian music apps also, like saavn and wynk."
312,Working propery nice ui...
313,Please add sleep timer
314,nice sound quality
315,This app is best music player then any other player in world
316,Love the interface. You guys nailed it. Thanks
317,"I can't use it if doesn't have lastfm support, though"
318,There should be a little animation when opening the bubble cause it looks really plain..a nd pls.keep the pause play and those buttons lower than high and also if you could have an easier option like tabs to make playlist and play only songs only from there it would be great
319,This is amazing! Can't believe I didn't find it sooner as I'm always looking for a good Music player. Keep it up.
320,loved it.  can there be a menu just to make Playlist so that we just select our Playlist and zoom..  it's done...  I loved this app.
321,Awesomatic app... great for multitasking.... yet it needs a lockscreen music tab so that users can pause or skip music without unlocking the phone...otherwise a great app...good job  Gg Wp
322,Very awesome app. Awesome idea and awesome execution.
323,"I rarely review apps so this one is truly special. The app is truly amazing and works so smooth, I love it. The developer is a magician, no seriously, the developer is AMAZING. Also, if lyrics could be found and implemented would make buMP the best app on the market."
324,And it has some awesome look too
325,Amazing app.  To be perfect it only needs lyrics support. Keep working and congratulations!!!!!
326,Expecting better features...
327,Loved it
328,Problem solved! Greatest app ever!
329,"Loving it so far. It's responsive and the interface is just lovely to look at. Only one thing bugs me,  how do I remove more than one song at a time from my now playing list?"
330,Keep the great work up gents!
331,"I love BuMP. It just works. But there is one thing I'm really missing, offline Spotify caching. I mostly listen to my playlists and for that I download them on my device so it does not eat up my data."
332,I like the Spotify integration.
333,cool
334,good
