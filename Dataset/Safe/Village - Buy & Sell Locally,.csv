45,"Village is my favourite local buy sell app! Lots of great local bargains to shop in our neighbourhood, some of which are literally next door! As a young family, it's been super helpful to buy preloved clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, and other kids or baby stuff from friendly families in our local neighbourhood. Likewise been a lovely way to freecycle or sell our kids used stuff - love how I just take a quick photo, add a few words, and then it's immediately available for sale locally üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
46,"Best selling app, love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Super quick to list, easy to chat with buyers, great local community feel, sold locally to someone in our neighbourhood same day. Now shopping for some amazing fashion and electronics preloved bargains for myself - lots of great local deals to choose from! Lovely way for our local community to help each other, waste less and do our bit for the environment! Thank you Village!"
47,Not in area
48,"Love Village! Best local buy and sell app by far, finally an app with real soul ‚ô•Ô∏è"
49,They force you to pay a membership
50,No buyers in my area just scammers
51,Pointless app opened once and then stopped working I wouldn't waste your time downloading it.... avoid
52,"Awful to use and ""customer service"" takes too long to reply to requests for help. Also asks for permission to make phone calls, which is rediculous. The app keeps freezing and you have to close it multiple times and reopen it in order to get it to stop freezing. You'd be better off with apps like shpock or olio tbh."
53,"This app has an easy interface but the worst part is that we have to pay for everything.We cannot see any other products listed.We keep on getting the notifications regarding the people's interest in our product but while we try to look into the chats,it asks to pay.This is really very ridiculous.I downloaded this app to be more comfortable in reaching out to customers nearby me or anywhere but this seems to be a scam."
54,Very frustrating when you want to open the app as it won't open and then you can't press back it won't let you so you have to close it from the middle/home button..you have to try at least 10 times before it will open it's very temperamental..not the best selling app I've experienced!!
55,"No one really buys anything on here. Its ridiculous. No one responds to messages, and they say it's free, but you have to pay for everything. You have to pay to send a message to someone."
56,Its a good app but there was no one near me but it is still a good app
57,Love it
58,Lots of great buys. Easy to use and understand. Also great community feel and chat feature. Kudos!
59,SPAM

70,Great business app for selling.
71,Very good place to sell things
72,No good It deleted my complete profile after one day. And asked me to create a new one. Plus it is not very busy Seems pretty empty.
73,Just started.
74,"Never felt more at ease selling on here, its better than shpock an all other sites I've used. I recommend this site to all. Just a shame their isn't more than 5 stars as I'd click more"
75,"Very nice marketing app, good to buy and sell In a good price"
76,The App is nice

79,This app take $106 from my bank account. Really????

81,Village is the best app for everyone. the support is always active and ready to lend a hand whenever possible.
82,"Very good , Love It, Its the best App for selling your stuff,"
83,"VILLAGE IS JUST THE BEST SITE, FOR SELLING AT ANY TIME. I LIKE IT."
84,Till now i only had scams...
85,A little bit complicated for me I can't seem to get the hang of it
86,No a single hit. It's a waste of time
87,I got logged out and never could log in again.and my ads were there to attract people and for decorations of his website.they want you to create new one and keep happening.but does they realise those ads never will reply to people?too many scammers and fake buyers.i saw too many people putting nudy pic as profile and no location or no any identification so just they are sex escort.not a good app
88,Haven't sold anything yet
89,dreadful - dont bother paying.
90,nice
91,"Brilliant, great, super selling and buying sites ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
92,good
93,goos
94,great
95,"The slimey developer trawls through gumtree ads then texts people to get you to download the app. It's a disgusting tactic, can't even view their website or policies due to constant 502 gateway issues."
96,"Been so lovely to meet more people on our street and exchange our stuff with each other. Easy user interface, really fast to browse and pictures of my stuff looks great on my phone's screen. Was super quick and easy to list our car, and also totally free! Best way to buy and sell in our local area. We recommend it to everyone! üíöüíöüíö"
97,"Taken my number from gumtree ad , I got a text asking if my items are still available after i replied yes they texted back asking me to post on the app how dare they waste my time ? My info is on gumtree for one purpose and its not to be solicited by lazy arse app developers."
98,sad that this app targets people through gumtree and then harrases them to pay to speak to people in order to sell goods!
99,way too pushy. they dont leave you alone!
100,Amazing for buying and selling stuff with friendly people in our area! Sold really quickly. Quick collection. Super simple and easy to use. Fun browsing the photos of beautiful secondhand stuff people share. Really love everything is local! üíïüíïüíï
101,DO NOT USE THIS APP! awful. and they use your gumtree ads to reach out to you and spam you to use this app. don't support it.
102,great app
103,"How dare you take my details from Gumtree and spam me, very intrusive you should be shut down!!"
104,"click sell, doesn't do anything. junk app"
105,poor
106,Harassing through Gumtree adverts where they text you pushing the app. This is such a weird tactic and feels creepy. Don't expect the developer to explain themselves so I'll be warning others of this app
107,along with alot of other people they messaged me through my gumtree ad promoting this app which is very intrusive
108,thanks for this app
109,very friendly.xx
110,good app i like it and please like it
111,"Love that everything is in our local community! Super friendly, trustworthy and reliable people, easy to chat with to ask questions. Lots of amazing deals on everything from furniture, to baby & kids stuff, to cars, to jobs and property, with great photos, fast and easy to use and no ads! Cool instant alert notifications of new stuff so I don't miss out on latest deals! For me Village is the best local buy sell app! Thank you Village!"
112,"just joined village,have put several items up for sale but still not quite sure how it works!!!don't no if you should put a price tag on your stuff or wait for offers and I certainly cant afford to pay to talk to people (else I would not be selling stuff for extra money ü§£üòÇü§£)so don't no how am meant to communicate with people"
113,Don't appreciate being text as if its someone intresed in my Gumtree ad but really they're trying to promote this app. which I won't be using due to the texting me pretending to be a customer!!
114,great app
115,set up add on gumtree.. and got a messge to my phone from this app saying would i put up the add on here.. not happy that someone is stalking peoples personal ads with deatils and using them to put on this site.. this is waste of time ..
116,Would let u see the message
117,"Terrible, annoying app"
118,nice app
119,Great!!!! üëàüëç üòä
120,generally decent stuff .
121,"Got approached through my gumtree advert, thought it was worth a shot, but will be uninstalling after a day. Can't see who is interested in items for sale unless you pay extra for 'chat', and takes round in circles with 'to continue you need to log into google play store' messages. Good idea, but too many unthought out issues at the moment to be of any use."
122,"Developer has the very shady method of harvesting people's numbers from Gumtree and using them to advertise this app, which is against their policies. Leaves a very bad taste on an app that already looks unintuitive and seems to have a lot of teething problems. Time spent spamming people would be better spent on making improvements to the app itself."
123,I'll
124,very helpful app
125,not good.keeps asking me to log in.wont let me see messages.waste of time. going to delete it now.

133,"Claims to be within walking distance yet ive looked at items 30+ miles away! Claims a raise of a hand is someone showing interest yet wheb you contact those people yiu eithet get no reply or not interested! Charge ¬£6.99 for a week of chat facility, i want a refund after less than a day!"
134,good
135,Can not complete car sale add asking me to fill in optional data
136,Just registered hope it will turn out nice
137,waste of time
138,rubbish
139,Seemed easy to use but won't let me access parts without logging in. When I try to log in just takes me to play store. Going round in circles

151,Very easy to use
152,lot of faffing unless you pay to speak to people . keeps asking me to log into Google app store . frustrating
153,exceptional
154,Took so much money for advertising even if item didn't sell. ¬£5.99 bosted fee and ¬£29.99 to chat with people not even one person contacted me. ¬£36 wasted for nothing. Never download this app. Not recommended at all.
155,"Nothing intuitive about this site. Facebook marketplace, eBay, Gumtree are a far superior and helpful alternative."
156,wasn't workong out for me om the end
157,very good site
158,good
159,very good didn't know about the app
160,"First time on here,not sure how this works."

165,great site
166,awesome app love it
167,Decent
168,excellent
169,"Half the things on this app don't work. It keeps telling me to ""log into Google Play store"". It never sends verification codes, never asked me for an email and won't let me add one. I have zero confidence this is going to lead to anything other than uninstalling the app."
170,1st time user
171,i dont understand how to work it
172,easy to load items to sell
173,been on half an hour and already got a shop set up with all my listings on. easy to use and so many features. loving this app!

182,"nothing came through about people looking. i also hadnt realised i had to pay on repeat,thought it was a one off."
183,nice
184,you can sell anything i love the app
185,nice
186,It keeps on telling me to log in when I want to see who has viewed my item
187,To many notifications... better shopping apps out there...
188,How do I cancel my subscription for the chatting to customers as I got a 7 day free trial then have to pay afterwards and wish to cancel now as my 7 days are up?
189,nice
190,you have to pay to see buyers comments(( so not free
191,rrally good
192,very good for selling
193,good
194,selling items on here can be hit or miss....
195,"Shameful. Whoever is in charge of the marketing techniques of this app should be fired. I, like many others who have left one star reviews, was texted on my private number referencing an ad I placed on Gumtree. The text was attempting to encourage me to download this app (which I have gone ahead and done specifically so I can write this review). Even more disgraceful is that none of the reviews referencing this issue have been responded to, but almost every other review has been. Again, shameful"
196,"I don't understand all those who leave comments that their details have been copied from gumtree. This is happening every day,even banks are sharing your details to others. In last couple of months who doesn't receive call for accident compensation? At least this website try to help you, me I didn't hear about village.co before."
197,"Not happy that you used my details from gumtree. I had to install to leave a review, but I will be uninstalling. Thought I had a potential buyer, to then realise someone was trying to get me advertise using another app."
198,"Waste of money and time, don't install this app, developer Motto is just earn money, they don't care about customer relationship You please tell me, if someone saw my ad in village app, I should know who's saw, because I'm a business man, I should contact them, but you charging high prices, and I don't know how much response I'll get"
199,Very good
200,Reported for breaking GDPR laws. Never use my mobile number to advertise.
201,STOP TAKING PEOPLES DETAILS OFF OF GUMTREE!!!! sending out spam texts just to try and boost your own app!!!! Stop texting people spam and useless texts. It's WRONG taking people's numbers from other sites just to try and boost your own app. Looking at other reviews and the amount of 1*s you have this tactic has failed anyway.
202,It needs a good update as it is really slow and just freezes up. The layout could be better but it's mostly about how slow this really is.
203,"Got a text message that seemed like a real person from an ad on gumtree, and I warily tried it out. Loading times are awful, app crashed a bunch, and not even useful for what I wanted to advertise. Should have stuck to the other reviews warning me. Shady and underhand business practice here just to get more downloads."
204,Its great love it
205,It's great love local stuff
206,"Similar to other reviews my contact details were taken from a gumtree ad, recieved a text from what I thought was a potential buyer only to realise it was just someone trying to gain downloads of this app, will never use now."
207,Items way to expensive
208,Very good app
209,I listed an item on Gumtree and these scummy people think it's ok to text you and tell you to put it on there app!! Why don't you just sod off
210,nive
211,"Didn't appreciate the use of my number from Gumtree. Woke up to a text message seemingly from a person who had seen an advert I'd placed on Gumtree (but had deleted about an hour later) I replied (still thinking ot was a real person) and had a text with a link to this app. Pretty shameful tactics tbh, don't appreciate it. Wouldn't touch this app with a barge hole judging from the other reviews anyway."
212,Fake
213,Please stop messaging people after they've posted ads elsewhere.
214,"Takes far too long to open, just send to be searching forever"
215,I posted an ad on gum tree and I receive a text.. Will be reporting this to gumtree..underhanded gits!!
216,Havent sold anythibg and keep seeing things for sale 33 plus miles away even though my map is correct
217,This is very bad. Waist our data.
218,Not loading app
219,So good app for all of us
220,"I wish there were more people using it and that i could use pics from my google pics with it but everything else is amazing. The app is super easy to use and i love the way it is set up to show you what is for sale in walking distance, but that you can change it to further away. Others are the oposite which is kinda lame cause if I forget to change it i unintentionly contact someone out of state. I really hope more people pick up on how easy this app is to use, and start using it here in Las Vegas."
221,"Very good customer service but no customers. You will never sell on this app. They don't have customers they have sellers. Nooo customers, üò≠"
222,"Dodgy. Posted an app on gumtree and got a text to re post on here. Bit 
dodgy, not using it"
223,"Onle have people list thier items but no one ever chat you up. Then one day 
i finally have a s***** guy ""chat"" me up in one of my listings, pretend to 
ask me where to meet up etc. Asking me how to use the app bla bla.. Do I 
looked like I'm the developer or customer service of this app! Wasting my 
time talking to him!!"
224,"After posting an add on gum tree I received texts asking me to join up to 
this app. Very underhanded. Will not use"
225,"Full of scammers some 1 called marie Bancroft tried pretending she ad 
throat cancer and was house bound so she has to get some 1 else to collect 
but then she sent me a fake paypal email sayin she had transferd me 420 
into my paypal 175pound for my stuff but she never mentioned anything about 
her putting an extra 245 in then she told me i had to go to a post office 
to send the money to a money gram for her as she cant get t a post office 
to pay it but she exspected me to pay 245 outa my own pocket till"
226,Takes to long to warm up the app when turning it on.
227,"I think if the company brought in more people to view the app it would be 
better but it kind of hard to sell things when their aren't many people on 
the app"
228,"All I got were txt asking for my email, then got sent PayPal scam emails, 
had 5 in 2 days, avoid!"
229,"It's a local buy and sell type of app with household items for sale or for 
free and other goods for sale. I live it üòä"
230,This is very bestest app in the world
231,It works great for meüíØ
232,"This app has almost no category to choose from what car model you are 
selling that not be a problem but they make u choose a models while they 
only give you 7 to choose from"
233,"I download this app and I search ps3 or ps4 slim or games etc I want to 
search these types of thing this app is good but make this app like olx app 
and this is beautiful"
234,"Love app especially the free sections. Lots of people in my area using this 
app.a AWESOME DEALS for me...KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK...KEEP GETTING 
BETTER... LOOKING FORWARD TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS FROM THIS COOL 
APP.GREAT FORMAT AND DESIGN."
235,Poor! Need Better Search! Always Need Map On When Visiting
236,The app wont even load up once installed
237,"No thanks, I'll come back when the app works properly. I read through the reviews before installing, it said it had been updated but not well enough by the looks of it. I'm in Merseyside and no thanks I don't fancy a bargain in Leeds. Yes, I know how to do the location settings but still it didn't fully show the local stuff. Disappointed."
238,fab app
239,Easy to use. Very happy with this app
240,"I am from Athens, Greece. Due to having 50k downloads, only 1 person is selling in my area (60 minutes away from me actually). So, why not go on Facebook groups of your area and contact sellers there?"
241,Wouldn't enable me to upload my profile - manually or via Facebook
242,Awesome keep it up developer
243,Extra Income
244,Very bad layout of app
245,"I just wanted to look for things local I clicked on one add that said 1 min walk away and when I clicked on the map it was located hours away not to mention another item was ""close"" to me (1025 mins away)"
246,"An item I looked at was ""637 mins walk from me"" really! I live in South Wales the item was in the Bristol area. I think that is more than 637 mins walk. Uninstalled. PS: this app is not too different from Shpock."
247,Unsure about it at this point
248,Very useful through buying and selling
249,Crashed five times on set up.
250,Best app
251,It's just a useless app for the user's who want to sell the stuff
252,Great
253,Good
254,"Easy and user friendly. Once it has enough people, it will be of great use to everyone.  Like a referral group.  Love it already!"
255,App consistently crashed to the point of being unusable.
256,"Great App! Yo, San Diego! Wya???"
257,Good app overall
258,Easy to post
259,Awful. I have a one year old Samsung phone and this app can't even pick up that I've given it permission to access my location. Pretty useless.
260,I really like this app..  Easy to use.
261,"I really like this app it's very easy to use, does what it says it does."
262,Great app
263,Can't disable it and everything is only within walking distance
264,Excellent  I'm proud of it
265,Easy to work and communicate with others viewing items is easier and all given in walking distance Amazing app.
266,"Cant use app without being forced to register for an account.  Unable to browse without being logged in. Instant fail of the entire ""village.co"" service"
267,"Hate it I will continue to use letgo,offer up,five miles an veragal sale just thought better app would be out there can't even get past sign up page"
268,Took for ever  to get my first buyer but I still think offerup is better
269,"Well, it sorta works, its just difficult to edit, when you want to add details it hangs there and does nothing, I know it's not my phone as other selling apps work perfect and scroll smoothly, gets tiresome after a while and you think "" do i really need to sit here faffing about with this ?"" Despite my items having several hundred views I've never sold anything on village or been made an offer ...... funny that ?"
270,"It needs a different way of managing the distance from you, walking distance is stupid."
271,Great! I can find the stuff I want with a low price :-)
272,1st user go around y'all ü§îüòéü§î!
273,I originally downloaded the app and it took a while to load but worked fine had to uninstall and install again as wouldn't load and now is telling me there is a local cache problem
274,It keeps telling me caches problems. Can't even log in
275,Happy
276,Its very useful app and grate way to make deals i really like this app
277,Its ok except I COULDNT SIGN IN! Should have an email option for tablets and ipads when you register
278,I used this app and 3 others but all of my items got 0 views on here where I had responses from other apps I live in a major city so at least 1 person should have viewed them
279,Every few days I am not able to access the app as I get a message to update on playstore when there is no update
280,Best way to make a great deal!
281,Hate it
282,Sucks
283,Continously exits the app after a few moments on it
284,Excellent app
285,I love it and very helpful and really nice people
286,Too many people offering to sell but not replying back or not selling at the end. This needs to stop as it is a waste of peoples time.
287,Very convenient for buying and selling with your local neighbors.
288,Have signed up to app and within days already selling. Its easy to use and hassle free
289,Garbage
290,Mrs
291,"Doesn't work, endlessly loads"
292,Does what it says on the tin. I often sell big items that I  want collected so is ideal!
293,"I like the app, only needs some checks on sellers as there are many of them that sell items but when you ask info or to buy they never reply back."
294,...
295,"Great in theory, but too many people offer to buy but then fail to go through with the purchase. Very frustrating"
296,Better and easier for local bargains
297,Not been able to use it just goes round and round
298,Almost no search criteria
299,"Wanna record videos, take photos, make and manage phone calls, view and send SMSs, locate me and my device, enable the camera and access my storage, what is that all for??????!!!!!!!"
300,Very simple. Very effective
301,I'm really getting to know my neighbours!
302,Its ok a bit slow and selling stuff takes time but a part from that ok I guess lol
303,Absolutley love this site...found my son a daybed and myself a table...reasonly priced and very close to my home
304,Just joined the village.
305,Despite many issues it's working again. The team is very professional.  As soon as matter was resolved they emailed me. So happy to see my chats and it's loads perfectly now.
306,"Never works for me. I get messages from Alex but that's about it, when I open it the circle thing swirls around and around continuously but I've yet to see what the app does."
307,"Keeps shutting down, I lost a sale due to this issue"
308,Great site.  Purchased couple items and was very pleased with them.  Easy exchange.  Thank you Village.
309,It is really easy for use and gread sellers and buyers.
310,"Great app, really easy to use, I have used it to buy and sell and have always been really happy with the results!"
311,Very easy to use and is free
312,Really good app. Found it easy compared to selling it on other bigger market player's website (eBay or Amazon). Would definitely recommend it for buying and selling. If u r looking for local buying and selling then this is really a good one. Easy features!
313,Found it a great idea and was about to use it however it keeps crashing whenever u reach the login screen. Please let me know if you can fix it. Thx.
314,Very nice shopping experience definitely use again 5 star
315,"Shpock still miles ahead here. This app has a lot of trouble loading - it only gets to the listings less than half the time. You also can't filter the items by time posted, which leads to a lot of wasted time looking at stuff posted by people who have clearly been inactive for weeks."
316,Best app ever
317,App never leaves loading screen. Complete waste of time
318,Loved
319,I didn't checked the whole things but I love the idea of a village sale. Do u think the old days neighborhood marketing systems come back on cyber whereas everyone knows everybody which is ur grans told u how the neighborhood markets was in their time. back to the past the old good days instead of back to the future lol üòäüòÅ great!
320,I don't have a lot to sell and I just came on here looking for a bike
321,Had some problem in early versions of the app but overall great concept and app for buying and selling things in my neighbourhood. Well done.
322,Finally started to work properly thank for the update
323,I had to uninstall the app 2x times. Just getting frozen and doesn't work üòî
324,"Village is a great idea, it's a virtual perpetual car boot sale supported by a real walking-distance face-to-face network. All those useful things people were hanging on to, but didn't get round to selling or using might as well go on village, and you can exchange with a buyer on the way to the shops. Baby stuff, laptops, bed frames, cake tins, pastry knifes, books, skipping ropes... Just check it before you leave the house!  The app makes it effortless to list something, just point and click. You can add t"
325,This site is an exelent site to buy sell all your unwated stuff. Alex who runs the site is always keeping you up to date with emails. First class. Keep it going.
326,"Its frozen , never got able to load"
327,"I got this app to open once -  it was good and I was interested in a few sales. Have not managed to get past the loading screen since then, have re installed, restarted etc."
328,"Liked the app until it stopped working. Doesn't even load now, stops on the loading screen. Would be great if you guys would sort this out."
329,"It always stopped at the loading screen and no further, I sent am email to help, please can you solve it. Thanks."
330,The app still does not open all the time. I have missed out on sale because of the problem. üòê still no change. Can't get into the app at all.
331,All I get is just the red page. Not good
332,"Looks good, a shame nobody in my neighbourhood is using it :("
333,Useless
334,"Really easy to use, and fast to add a item and sells quickly and excellent customer service. Really love my new app! Had loads of things to put up to sell but ebay and gumtree are very long winded- this app is perfect! :-)"
335,Easy to buy thing close to your house. Thank you!  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
336,"I had to uninstall because it was continuously spamming notifications. If I install an app I know when is time to use it, i don't need notifications to remind me."
337,"Most of the time I can't open the chat and it changes my theme for some reason.  Also,  when I try to sell something sometimes it loads and freezes and It doesn't upload the list."
338,"App often wouldn't open. Wouldn't get messages in ""real time"".  I deleted the app and downloaded again and it worked. Now a week later and it is not opening again. The chat may be causing the interface problems but that is a key function in the app when trying to answer the questions involved in buy/sell function."
339,"It is a great concept and I even had one successful transaction, but there  after it kept stalling and i couldnt enter it, Good customer  response, problem was fixed."
340,"When you run it it will ask you for access to your current location and you can see message ""to locate nearest deals"". However than in your profile you can see that your location had been confirmed!? Requires ton of access. ""walking distance"" is a driving distance if you ask me. Worst of all is that it seams like items are located based on your current location than actual item location. And remove those sharing buttons, they take 40% of the ad"
341,"Extremely promising app, great UX design, loads of features, feels like a mini ebay on steroids."
342,Nice app
343,Downloaded app but can not use it wont open
344,"The app crashes when I open up the chat, so I can't respond to the people interested in buying my things! Please fix. :)"
345,I can not get past the red start screen.. reinstalled it already.. and now it's stuck again but don't know why. Advice?
346,Can't get into the app
347,I can't get.into my app...how can I contact the village team please?
348,Love it!
349,Really user friendly and intuitive UI. Well done to the developers and all involved in making this app a reality and enabling Tower Hamlets residents to recycle/sell unwanted goods with ease.
350,I have sold a lot of items to really nice people. Its great having something local. Have recommended to a few of my friends. When something goes wrong with the app village can always be contacted to help.
351,"Good idea, but needs polish. Annoying app UI features - can't do a search without setting up alerts. Back button exits app, and then app has to start all over again. But kudos for doing something focused on Tower Hamlets. Would be nice to know what business model is, and some background to the people behind it."
352,So easy to buy and sell things to people near you and to friends and family and really straightforward and fun app to use. Lots of great stuff for sale too!
353,Lovely very easy to manage. And the people is lovely
354,"So handy, would definitely recommend to anyone in Tower Hamlets!"
355,Scam advertising of this app. Also you can't use it without posting 10 items for sale first
356,"Simple, effective and friendly :)"
357,"Simple and easy to use, and enjoyable too! Will be sharing it with all my friends"
358,"Great app, really easy to find great stuff"
359,Really good experiences using this app.  Wonderful items and lovely people. It's been running fine for me . Would recommend to local people.
360,Just downloaded the app and it keeps on crashing. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
361,One of the best app on android for buying & selling locally.
362,Love the integration with What's app
