it is what you would expect. but it could wait until you are completely finished with your thoughts.
uninstalled immediately. too bad it's only trial.
"This app has given me a new perspective of myself, my relationships, and the life I live. I look forward to Journaling every night now, and the insight it brings is amazing. I signed up for the free trial and hopefully can afford to keep my subscription to it. If you have a hard time keeping a journal habit, the AI prompts and responses make it so intimate it's easy to stick to it. When typing, the black prompt button does block some text. If fixed, I'll change my rating to 5 stars! Please fix!"
Not what I was looking for
"I recently tried the Insight Journal app and unfortunately, I can only give it a one-star rating. Like countless other subscriptions, this app adds to the ever-growing list, making it financially burdensome. What disappointed me right from the start was that the app immediately prompts for payment information even before the free trial begins. This approach raises a red flag. Paying ¬£6.99 (¬£7) per month to be dictated by a database feels excessive. This new app isn't worth that level of pricing."
Great app! I absolutely love Journaling and having a response to what I've written. It's like a spiritual counselor for self love!
Awesome
Worst behaviour that it show its paid options after download .
"I like the app for its simplicity, specifically the daily assisted journaling (this is available even if you don't pay). I haven't tried the paid features or the 14-day trial, might give it a try later on. But honestly, even if you don't pay, the journaling alone is such a big help already. Thank you for zero ads despite it being free."
"Too ambitious of a new app to charge this much on the first go. Result: A lot of bad reviews at the beginning. What you guys should have done is, start with a very minimum pricing, and include many features to access for free also. If your app is genuinely that good, people would get used to it and purchase it eventually."
Cannot continue without subscription
NICE
so much prompts to choose from and great insight I love this journal üììüìî

irritating in the start...... asking for money
great app it

good
I don't really like writing thought I give it a try and within the first 10 minutes I'm feeling better about myself and the choices I made
"awesome way to put my ""pen to paper"" or ""thoughts out of my neighborhood"""
Be weary & cautious ‚ö†Ô∏è
very good service provider
14 day trail only

"I have a question. If you hide everything great about the app behind a massive pay wall, how do you expect people to trust your app and not lose money?"
great App ;by the way this application using technology like ReactJS and JS and Html and CSS. can you tell me this right or Wrong.
good appüëç
brilliant
"fantastic assisted journalling app! it prompts me to recount experiences, memories, and life events to see them through a different lense and create positive meanings to them. I am really blown away. can say that I'll be purchasing the yearly and ditching my mind journal to include this into my daily reflection time block on my tablet."

I just downloaded it and so far it is very interesting it seems great. Makes me want to keep on going with it to see what else is there for me. it may not work for others and people might think this is no good but you won't know unless you try. And I tried it and so far so good.
I used the 14 day free trial but i only lasted 5 minutes as i didn't realise that most things you try you have to subscribe to each one that's ridiculous.
"Actually i give two star's. Reason without supricion you not read single word. Firstly i interest this app, so i selected more than categories like psychology, person development, but in there every time showing, first purchase supricion. So i uninstalled this app."
"This app is beautiful! I wasn't expecting a response after I was done writing, but when it did, it has you feel heard, and points or what makes you a beautiful unique person. I love it, it's encouraging and therapeutic.. great app"
Really a beautiful app. I Just LOVE IT.
This is really nice and helpful to me especially I don't have anyone to talk to about this things my questions and curiosity are answered with calmness. It's also easy to use.Plus there are no ads that are disturbing me in this app .
Nice app.
Satisfied a lot this App Helped me a lot thank u ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's too expensive for the start it can cheaper for a year or two
"Do not Install, it requires 1300 INR/YEAR üòï"
This is a pretty educational app
I feel like I have wasted so much money on therapy. I know it's an AI and all but it just feels right. I do not have to worry about the chance of bias advice.
Incredible tool for introspection. It's like having your own personal therapist with customized prompts! So obsessed with this app!
Astounded by the creative and varied list of prompts. Keeps me inspired and motivated!
Great App! Works well across platforms so I am excited to use it both on my mac and android phone.
A truly remarkable resource for self-improvement. The curated prompts feel like I have a personal life coach. Can't recommend enough!!
