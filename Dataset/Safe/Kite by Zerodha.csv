0,"No one can beat zerodha kite app in the field of trading. But there is biggest problem in chart of indexs like finnifty, banknifty and all big indexs. Chart interface is not good. You must switch your chart interface like dhan and fyer chart interface."
1,Margin increase..when you need money.
2,Extremely useless UI! Stop moving items here and there! Now there's just no option to invest in IPO
3,Zerodh Please new trdingview par Chart Update kB aaye ga ?
4,Best app for trading
5,"There is a problem When I use zerodha and select trading view chart for trading & use cursor for see some particular candle, entire charts are moving with cursor.please solve the problem."
6,NEED some updates...VERSION....
7,Good
8,One can use this app for equity trading. I never recommend it for option trading. No proper in app option chain. You can access it only thru web direct. Non user friendly causes delay in order placement especially for option buyers. I think zerodha is after money making now. They charge 200 fee just for nothing. Very negative impression.
9,Excellent App.
10,Zj I'll nuaaaaa Nygggiigogoogggggg
11,Graph not display very definitely rivew
12,Good üëç
13,Please add figure and percentage both in gtt order. Because when in hurry percentage creat confusion in estimating SL and Target. And improve the app so that we can see chart and P&L in one place.

44,Good apps user friendly
45,New update ko plz plz plz hta do....bakwaas....auto refresh hota rhta hai ..baar baar.....jb bhi open kro
46,"Lacks essential features. Ironic to see leading discount broker's app doesn't have all the features. The entire console is unavailable on the app, any thing under the menu of Console prompts to open in web browser. Unable to understand why Zerodha hasn't made those features available in Kite or why haven't they launched seperate app for Console?"
47,"Good supb now today i update my kite apps in mobile,get a priveous interface look at present time . I m so haapy its oprate easy and use tools and so many things in one click .. Maintain it. Easy to oprate in mobile .. Good job kite developer Team"
48,"Worst apk now a day if I'm placing my order it is not hitting my target I miss my target, and I have lost it better to go for upstox great apk my experience with zerodha is worst now a day"
49,Very worst update..old version was good
50,Unable to even login to account. As it get logged off automatically even after entering otp multiple times.
51,"Asking me to restart the application and make the payment again due some issues the signature. kindly solve this issue, I don't want to pay twice."
52,The App is easy to use but if we comparing the other app's they also easy to use and also they give us more features and facilities to trade. Option chain is very poor and lack of information. If we explore other app's they have quite good interface and also very informative option chain. Its hard to believe zeroda is No.1 broker in our country. Zeroda if you read my reviews please update your features and improve options chain.
53,"It's good app for intraday trading as it provides facilities to set ""Stoploss & Target and GTT Order's"" while placing the order which is very helpful for Intraday Traders but this app certainly has a Lot of Room for Improvement as many features are difficult to use and adding ""Options Scripts"" to the Watchlist is very-very Troublesome and is like a Nightmare..., it needs Improvement as soon as possible...."
54,Awesome.
55,"Very good, but still needs some improvement First of all on mobile app there is no option to save scales of more than one chart in trading view charts option, scale should be saved within chart when lock scale, also switching from dark to default mode scale lock reset which should not be, second in this chart scale properties view doesn't fit on mobile and not convinent to use. Please make update to app with this feature"
56,Updates are losing faith Chart IQ version dose not support multiple chart whether on mobile or web. Trading view support multiple chart but there are no indicator of chart IQ Mobile version never go to full screen There is no full screen button on mobile view whether horizontal or vertical view. This full screen button given by angel broker also removed. It may be tie-up with these brocker Kuch to easy Karo for mobile user

106,Good sarvice
107,"Unable to install the app, since two years I'm using kite."
108,Not compatible for me
109,App becomes very much slower and hangs when volume increases in F&O trading. Especialy on expiry day and that is after 2:45 PM. Due to which we have to face huge sleepages. It has become very much deficult to trade through kite in options trading due to such issues. Basket orders shows wrong calculations on margine requirement especialy after 2:45 pm due to increase in volume and due to which orders are rejected. Basket orders takes too much time to get executed due to kite hanging issue.
110,"Cannot get my login details after, 10 days of registration"
111,Don't stuck in this trap Clearly it's a trap
112,Now fantastic update in compare to other broker that we now add any option on watchlist directly from option chain Many many thanks for this But Kindly give candle countdown to bar close option on trading view chart

116,In zerodha web platform I couldn't save chart drawings in multiple time frame for same script in same time. For example- if i save some drawings on HDFC Hourly chart then same drawing doesn't show in HDFC 5 min chart for the same layout. Need to resolve this. How is this expect bigger glitch from ZERODHA?....
117,I'm new in share market trade but I have lost my money by using zerodha without selling my holdings share got lost and fund balance also got deducted Please refund my balance
118,Very good
119,Very Helpfull to take and place trade.
120,Whatever analysis I do on chart it doesn't save and when I save manually it changes whenever I refresh the chart
121,"Installed app, initiated account opening, completed entire process. Was told that login id password will be sent in next 72 hours. Been more than 120 hours but mail received yet with login id and password. Very disappointing. Will not recommend app"

136,Always send wrong massage of my balance amount

140,"I've been using this app for last 2 years, and trust me broking charges are toooooo high in this app. Go for another app instead of this üòº"
141,Pls provide the option chain in the commodities segment.
142,Just Mind-blowing...Just loved it
143,Zerodha is well best trading app and services all are excellent. Price time on time and very very appropriate it.
144,Nice app
145,New updated app logs out itself. Loading of stock price takes lot of time. Network issue is more. Suddenly today morning I was unable to open the app. Update password took half day. Worst app. Not effective like before Self explanatory please read carefully and understand
146,It's best app in the industry
147,Very bad service. The app screen freezes during market hours. Can close open intraday positions. Ultimately Zerodha squares off positions at loss. They will get their brokerage & other charges. Customers will be at Loss. This has happened twice in a week's time. Horrible experience. Please don't think that you have a monopoly. Please acknowledge that & focus on making business operations stronger. We are small people & we know the pain of loss. You people will not understand that pain. Very bad
148,I always face withdrawal issue with this app.. Please look into it..
149,"How do I send an email to customer support requesting for urgent help with my login problems that I am facing. Whenever I call, the Voice bot asks for Ticket number which also I am unable to generate. For last 7 hours I am going in circles with Kite App to site to Authy App and again back to kite app or zerodha site. I fail to understand why the site does not provide for an email address and a Chat Bot which will be easier to communicate."
150,Trailling Stop Loss Position display day pl Position sort by day pl
151,Overall the app is nice but there are some bugs. Like I bought a stock at NSE but in my portfolio section within the kite app for that stock it shows as BSE and the corresponding BSE closing price. But if I open portfolio in console it shows the portfolio correctly for that particular stock as NSE and NSE corresponding price under console. But in app portfolio it shows BSE. Please correct these bugs as they cause confusion regarding the exchange at which the share was bought.
152,Please provide GTT for MIS trading. You How could place target & SL at once?. Very urgent & important. The only disadvantage in zerodh.
153,Terrible experience. You will loose money not in trading but definitely using this app . Used this app more than 2 year and suffered a lot.
154,PLEASE MAKE FOR MULTIPLE MOBILE USES
155,Nice and easy tonoperate.
156,Good app
157,21June2023: The most unreliable app for trading must go to Kite based on my experience. Old: Some features not working Technicals when opened shows a blank page
158,Thank you so much for your quick and smart support...now I'm able to tarde thank you once again
159,Ltp price stuck
160,Discusting...I never seen this type bed app. After many day's I have not received any i'd pasword of my dmate account. And no any helpline nomber at there.
161,I added money to the account and next morning 88.5 rs are deducted without any information. Just opening balance in the statement. This looks like an unethical deduction. Will be moving my demat. Hidden charges.
162,"Worst app, worst experience. I bought 1 share in 184 rupees and then I sold that share in Rs 205 rupees but I got only 22 rupees. Where is rest of the money?"
163,My kite app not login when i call them they behave very bad Don't install this app they don't help when u need them worst app
164,Aapke yaha bhi Kam band karege faltu ka Paisa bahut lag jata hai jaise amc ac mantence ye sab faltu ka lagta hai jo ki grow me free hai aaplog ka bazzar khatm ho jayga dheere dheere arar yahi hal raha to
165,Ok
166,I believe that Dhan is a more modern and feature-rich trading platform than Kite. I would like to encourage you to consider adding the following features to Kite: The ability to trade in TradingView Drag-and-drop functionality of Buy/Sell orders on chart. Better charting tools More advanced technical analysis features I believe that these features would make Kite a more competitive trading platform. Feels like it's the right time to switch to Dhan if they don't take these points seriously.

It should be as simple as dragging it to the position of choice on the chart itself like MT4, Ctrader etc. The current Stop loss order should not get cancelled automatically at the end of the trading day, it should last till the position is closed by the trader manually.
