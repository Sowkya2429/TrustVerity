This stopwatch will never stop(I have tried it once)
RHIS IS THE APP I BEEN LOOKING FOR I just couldn't figure out how to name them at first. PLEASE if you ever decide to make it so that you can preset the tie of the stopwatch it would be the most helpful app in the world and I would be so so so happy but thank already for this!!!
the lap button is too small. Also there is not any kind of tactile feel if the lap button has been pushed. Results laps not recorded of double entry

Need a way to prevent the screen from dimming or locking while it is running

Good
"Bad, I am sad"
"Greate Greate stopwatch app if only ONE very important think. If you add option ""ask before remove laptime"" THE APP WILL BECOME ONE OF THE BEST ON PLAY MARKET"
"Simple to use, it gives me a stopwatch tile, something the app the watch started with lacks."
The best
"I only use the app on Wear OS. I love having a stopwatch that can track laps (or whatever your workout equivalent is), and will show the times of all the previous laps. It's simple and works well, I just wish the design were a little more modern and elegant."
"like it, would be perfect if it had a countdown timer also"
Brilliant!
It's pretty good.
I am truly amazed. I have never ever seen such a high quality stopwatch app in my life. Maybe it is even the best app I have ever used! It feels like the apple of stopwatches. So sad that there is no ads or payment options in the app because I want to show my gradiute to the developers but there is no way ðŸ˜¢
"2022-01-25 Lo instale hace unos dias y me encanto, cuando terminas de cronometrar en tu reloj lo podes sincronizar al telefono, a mi me vino de 10 porque el stopwatch de mi Galaxy Watch4 esta bug y si detenias el cronometro se bugeaba, con este estoy re contento, tiene para tomar el tiempo de vueltas."
Awesome app. Can you please do something like long press second button resets stopwatch I am currently swimming and its not so easy sometimes to press the reset button. Thank you
"Seems to work fine, downloaded to see if it had Tile support, currently does not. Please add Tile support now that it's available to all developers, since Google refuses to add one to stock WearOS... (Reply to Dev, Google has a Timer Tile in stock WearOS, I see no difference between the update rate for that and a Stopwatch)"
Works great across my Fossil sport watch and my Pixel. I like that i can use one of the physical buttons for start/stop and the other for laps. Syncing is always smooth. Nice app!
Best App for wear os but my only request is it will be very nice if we can see the current lap time
"Awesome app, I use it just on my watch and it's work well even if there is a bug: if you pause the stopwatch and leave it there for a while, when you restart it it's not fast to restart, you can't restart it from the fisical button on the watch and when it finally start the time it's incorrect (as if you have never stop it). Moreover, there is two things that you can improve in my opinion: add the clock in the main screen of the app (it's useful having always the real time at a glance) and change the refres"
"App works great! I'm only able to use it on my phone and not on my watch. This is NOT the developer's fault! If you have a Samsung brand watch, it uses Samsung Wear for the applications and widgets. This is clearly designed (as it says in the name) for Android Wear. I have ZERO connection with this company or any of its employees, but I hate to see a good app get a bad rating because someone misread or misunderstood something."
Dope stop watch. Didnt even read any instructions. It just worked on my phone and my watch just as you would expect.
numbers not running/showing up on the watch only the phone. stupid. and freezing.
really heavy on battery usage. my Samsung S7 went from 50%to 5in less than 3 hours.
"Won't sync or load onto my Samsung S3 Frontier at all. Gives a message, ""Looks like you have nothing to sync..."""
Well done! All as described plus added bonus of allowing control of stopwatch with my gear S3 as well as my android wear watches. Great for one who likes gadgets and programs made well for them. Thank you!
"I got this app to use on my watch while exercising. UI and functionality 
are good but I am giving it 3 stars because on the watch, the actual time 
display is extremely small and since I work out without my glasses, it is 
virtually unreadable. Otherwise a good app."
nice app
"Edit: Working as designed now. Uninstalled from phone and watch. Reinstalled. Working. Simple design that works well so far. Would love to see a timer / interval timer added to the app as well.   Seems to work on the phone. Can't get past the first screen on the watch though. Also, every time I open the app I get the tutorial pages again.  Tutorial is on the phone. And its a Ticwatch S with Android Wear 2.8. Would love to be able to use this."
Great app.  'X' symbols halfway outside the screen in light theme. Buttons in cards theme are better on the lower side. Please give option for  changing font color  and it would be nice if the delete symbol is scaled down a bit. ðŸ˜Š
Thank you. This is by far the BEST stopwatch app for Android wear.
"I couldn't believe how poor the stopwatch selection was for Android Wear coming form a Pebble. Something basic like laps missing was a deal breaker and if you left the app up you couldn't tell the time. This app fixes those basic problems. I still wish there was one stop watch and timer app with even more functions, but this is more than adequate and better than the stock option. Being able to change the lap from the card and not opening the app is very handy."
Awesome app for runners. Great for interval training. Simple to use and u can export the lap times. Thanks!
"The default Wear stopwatch has major issues when running - it doesn't stay on screen, the card for it doesn't remain at the top of the pile, and there are no start/stop controls from the card. Basically it's useless for timing things with any degree of accuracy. This app fixes all that, looks better and backs up the results. Should be the standard for all Wear devices!"
Love the sync to phone option where I can see all my laps. Thank you
"I would argue that this is the best stopwatch on Android wear.  It's not perfect, but as a free app, I can't complain.  It takes a few tries to sync to my phone, but that's really my only major complaint.  And Electric Wave is pretty good about updating.  It might not do things like best lap or average lap times, but at least you can delete laps and most importantly, export to XLS format.  And did I mention it's probably the best stopwatch on Android wear?"
Stops on startup.
