Why can we not upload photos for items that does not have a picture? When trying to take a pic or upload a pic the app freezes
Nice
"Horrible. The ""scan barcode"" option did not work for a single item at The Bay. Navigating through the app just brought us to The Bay website. It never linked with the products in store."
The walmart registry isn't syncing up in my account. It just keeps saying error. It said mot found over and over them loaded it but won't add any of the items
Setting up wasn't too hard. And as you use it you start learning its features. Very useful for making a registry in Canada (QC in my case) and allows importing the item from any store website. The only issue is when it's doesn't load all the data of the item so you have to enter it manually. Takes a couple more minutes but isn't a deal breaker.
"Couldn't get ant websites to connect yo add a gift, even Fable, whose registries are through MyRegistry, sooo."
I havent did this wish list befor im struggle to get gifts and on paying my rent hlep
Hard to navigate
UI not intuitive. Not obvious how to add gift to gift list. Can't add free-form (type in words) gift; have to have pic or code or link. Had high hopes for something better than Excel list. Nope
Horrible. Absolute garbage app. Doesn't work as described. Only synced a small fraction of items from my other registries. Uninstalling immediately.
"I like that you can easily add items to My Registry through the ""share"" button on any website. Much more convenient than other platforms. I am just disappointed that it continues to crash which makes using the app frustrating."
"Was good at first loved it and easy. Now I can't access it when I click on the link it says maintenance but when I try and actually go into the up comes up saying hey alysha we're happy your here then I select mom and the app stops working or doesn't load. I now domt know what people have brought nor what I have in there to put it in a different app. I've re download it as well. If there is going to be ""maintenance"" I should have to update the app."
"Stopped working, needed to uninstall and install again. I can't add any more gifts from the stores. The other registry that I made I can't see anymore. Even after I uninstalled and install again, no change. It seems like it only works for awhile and it stops."
"I used to love this app, but now when I try to add an item from a browser (ie not Amazon), it can't capture all the details nor can I edit the item later to add more details (like a photo). This app is now worthless and I'll have to find a replacement."
"The sync option for one of the websites has been down for days, and because of this, multiple people have bought the same item without realizing it & I now have to reach out to people and ask them to return gifts since there's no other way for me to remove or change items through the app directly. Thanks guys!"
"Cant just surf the net and add items at a click like advertised. Ive tried for 10 minutes, then i just deleted the app. Waste of time"
Hared
"Used this successfully during my first pregnancy in 2020. Just reinstalled it for my second pregnancy and it just doesn't work! I can't add any gifts to my list, no matter what I try. Just get a meaningless ""tutorial"" but I can't actually add gifts. Pointless."
"Every time I open the app, it automatically takes me to ""Special Offers"" where it tries to get me to sign up for emails from third parties. I click ""skip,"" and it'll take me back to the home page, then back to the ""Special Offers"" page. It does the same thing when I uncheck each of the boxes and click ""Submit."" It will not take no for an answer apparently. The app will be unusable unless I agree to be signed up for these spam emails from third parties, which I will not do, so the app is useless"
"No way to change it to English? I have tried so hard with this app to get it to work, but I literally cannot use it if I can't understand what's it's saying. I tried going through customer support and they said there is no setting to switch to English. I just have to use a web browser, which is unfortunate bc I do every on my phone! Time to look elsewhere.. not worth the struggle."
"Very bad app. I have a baby shower registry. Guests are buying presents and it's not showing on an app, it's not synchronized. So people keep buying double presents. I called customer service and they haven't been helpful, just ignored me very nicely. Ivana"
"Increasing from one star after the developer explained how to add items, it was not intuitive from the start though"
Very glitchy. Wayy too many ads. Rather use the site directly.
"WHY IS APP ACTING CRAZY!!! NOT OKAY TAKES TIME TO CREATE A REGESTRY SO FOR IT TO JUST WORK WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT IS NOT OKAY!!! CONCEPT IS AMAZING, EXECUSION IS POOR. PLEASE FIX WHATEVER BUGS ARE IN THIS APP, THANK YOU!!"
"Ads make scrolling glitchy & inconsistent. Friends expressed confusion about ensuring purchases were showing up in the registry. Tedious to mark off each individual item; would prefer the option to select multiple at a time for marking as purchased/deleted. Gift list needs to be the main screen when opening the app. Only perk is having registry items from various places gathered in to one, but w the annoying issues, it would be just as much stress to manage multiple (simpler) registries."
"I have found this so helpful, bring able to add things from lots of different websites. The fund is great too incase people want to donate towards something."
Love that I can put gifts from multiple stores on one app!
"Adding things for the first time took a minute to figure out then. Once figured out, it was relatively easy to use."
Allows you to put items from different stores/ platforms
"Cool concept, but doesn't work for me. I can't get anything to syncs nor does the button pop up on my browser. I was really looking forward to using this but sadly disappointed."
I've this app it's very easy to use and saves you alot from random gifts been sent to you.
"Actually the worst time Ive ever had doing anything. Wanted to use the barcode scanning option for in-person selections, does not work for anything anywhere. Just another labor intensive run around for online shopping for unseen registry items. Wasted hours of time."
Favorite Registry
Worst app ever. Can't even click one button without it crashing
Nice good
Real easy app to use!!
It doesn't show everything on the registry. It doesn't show things in the store which are not sold online. I didn't like that and I didn't bother sharing.
"Really decent app, however, sometimes for example on the baby registry it doesn't say who bought what if they purchased multiple things from the registry."
"So far this app is awesome! I like when things are EASY. And this is very intuitive. I had a question and the phone rang to a person, who was very helpful. Even the live chat was helpful. It's a lot of fun to use too!! Love this!"
"I love this app I use it all the time for birthdays, christmas, baby showers, and house warming parties it's so easy to use and share! I'll be using this all the time!"
"I followed the instructions and successfully added from a website, however pictures don't load to it and there's no link to the website. Will be contacting the email provided for further troubleshooting"
"After update, we're back on track!"
Very easy to have my gifts all in one app. Like that it can sync with my Amazon gift list.
Great App.
"Really like this app it's super convenient, but I haven't been able to view my gifts for awhile. It says they are there but won't show them. I'll change my review when the issue is fixed"
So far so good! I love being able to use items from different retailers.
Sometimes app glitches out but for the most part it works great!
I am no longer able to see the gifts I added or gifts purchased. I need to log on from a computer to do so. The scanning feature also isn't working on the app.
Easy experience and convenient
App will no longer display my gifts or purchased items. I have to log into the website on the internet to see anything. Tried deleting the app and re installing it but it continues to show no gifts and no purchases. Loved it when it was working.
Look at many different apps for gifts...this is the best. Had to uninstall a bunch after using this one
Doesn't work properly. Can't add items from websites not on the main list.
"The app is lagging at the moment. I tried uninstalling it amd reinstalling but that did not work. Please fix this issue. Also, whenever I sort things out, somehow, items will end up on top in the beginning. To which I have to sort out again. Other than those issues, the app work pretty good."
Great
"The app is not working, it keeps loading for minutes. When it finnaly worked, it endee up crashing. Is it possible to fix this issue? Other than this the app is amazing!"
Keeps crashing
App stopped working within half a day of using it.... very disappointed
"Update: app kept crashing, but I uninstalled and reinstalled and is now working fine. I like that it's easy to add gifts from websites"
At first it worked now it wont show all my items not let me resync. Very frustrating.
It was going really good but now I can't read the messages send by gift givers..
Very easy to add anything from any online store from your browser or another shopping app. Made it super easy to just grab things from whatever site I wanted.
Wow that was easy. I was appointed baby registry and my baby girl can shop and so many places. Well registering has never been as easy as it is here. She is having so much fun on the app. Thank y'all for that! She is my special as I know her daughter will be to her ! 💯
"Nothing I scann works. Horrible app I have scanned crate and barrel, William sanoma, dicks and even TARGET 0 THINGS WORK AWFUL APP STAY AWAY!!!!!"
UPDATE: STILL DOESNT WORK AFTER UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING TWICE.** I loved this app so much but it just totally stopped working. I can't even add to my registry on their website...so bummed
"Stopped working after syncing 2 registries. Always pops up with error that my registry is already synced, but it is not. Now visible from visitor view either. Good idea but execution is more stress-inducing than efficient."
"I just wasted 10 minutes of my life downloading this app and trying to add an item to the registry and then writing this review. When I browsed the item I wanted, I clicked the share button, then clicked MyRegistry. The button to ""ADD TO MYREGISTRY"" does not work at all... for any item, but the ""CANCEL"" button right beneath it does."
The new update is terrible- isn't allowing new gifts to be added to the registry.
"Was working at first, and now won't let me add products the button is unresponsive when tapped. Also when I update the product image (because more times than not, the app will not link the product image), it doesn't save even though it behaves as though it worked. I have emailed Support in hopes this can be resolved. Will be a shame if all my registry work.so far has be started over with another provider."
"Unable to sync any wishlist already existing, takes forever to add manually and the app keeps crashing. Not worth the struggle of adding pictures and details for each item, might as well send it directly to whoever needs your list!"
Awesome app and love the online version of this site. It’s easy to send to my fam and friends.
They dont buy the gifs for you.....
"Best wedding app I have found!I LOVE that this app allows me to have a Honeymoon Fund, and I can link all of my separate registries to this one app! It has made my life so much easier. So very thankful I found this!"
"Terrible app!! Can only add manually, there's no option to add via a pasted link. Makes the process so much harder, their website is much the same. I've only been able to add using a browser add-on, doesn't make it easy when you want to add something quickly when you're out and about!"
Great app. I use it all the time
My wife and I used this after we purchased our first home and this was so amazing! It was so easy to put multiple stores all in one location! It was nice to not have to be restricted to one store! Definitely would recommend! It was user friendly👍🏻
"I used this app for our wedding registry, our first born and AGAIN now for our 2nd child. I’m impressed how easy and smooth it is for me to organize items and also for our guests to navigate the website, see items and mark off that they are purchased."
doesn't even work
The Developer fixed the issues with Android 12. Thank you!
"Highly recommend!!! I am very pleased with this app. I had a few snags in the beginning with syncing, but my calls were answered promptly and pleasantly, and issues resolved immediately. The app and website are user friendly. I love the convenience of having a one stop registry for my guests."
"Infuriating! I literally cannot get anything to add, it won't find my Amazon wishlist & just keeps taking me in circles on other sites. An absolute waste of time."
Perfect for Couples on the go - Love this app. When I think of something we could use I can just look it up and put it on the registry! It couldn’t be easier or not convenient. Thanks for making shopping for our wedding stress free!!
I've been looking for an app that helps share ideas for holidays and special occasions to share and use within my family to make it easier. This is awesome. Just wish I could save other people's lists within the app so I can find and share them myself and others for occasions.
You can't view other registries on here. Trying to add a link to a site is impossible. I wanted to use this for Christmas but I can't actually add what I want. You have to go through their suggested sites.
This app is great. Been using it for a while to keep track of all my gift lists.
I compared this app with Babylist and ended up going with MyRegistry. I love the ability to sync all my store registries and I take advantage of all the completion discounts.
I had used it for my baby registry now I’m using it for the holidays. Great app
Impossible to add from the web was forced to Uninstall and try a different app
So fun and convenient!Any time I see anything from ANY store I can add it to my wish list so easily and keep it all in one list. My friends and family love not having to switch between wish lists. I love this app!
I’m using this app to build my family’s Christmas wish list. I love it
I love the ease of adding products by using the share feature. I've used this app on the desktop as well. I'm using it qithy family to create Christmas wish lists. It's awesome !
Crashes every time opened on Pixel 4a. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Power cycled phone. Issue persists. Edit: Issue resolved. Still occasionally crashes significantly less so.
Works great a nice way to keep track of lists for hard to please people.
(Developer fixed issue) the issue was fixed fast. I love this app dose exactly what you need :). App is not opening uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and the app will not open. I have pixel 6 on Android 12 if this info is needed (used to work fine on old phone)
I mean it works. But if I have an item visible in my browser on my phone the only way to put it in the registry is completely manually. Take a screen shot and fill in all the information. The flexibility to use the search function has yet to search for anything I needed or wanted successfully.... I think I'm going to go use an excel spreadsheet. This isnt more convenient for anybody except data sniffers.
"Makes creating gift lists to share with family very convenient. However, after sharing my list, the app will no longer open. I'd like to making updates and changes, but the app is just not functioning. Despite uninstalling and reinstalling, I am unable to use the app and may need to discontinue use of the service altogether. Disappointed in what could have been a real game changer."
After closing the app it immediately pushed a notification to get me to open it again. Horrible
This app is amazing. I'm from South Africa and registries aren't a big thing over here. I tried a couple of our local ones and they just didn't make sense. This one is great because you link the store to your registry. So easy to use and it looks so adorable once done!
USER FRIENDLY!
"Glitchy, barcodes are not synced."
Very difficult to use
You can not add anything to your registry from a website.
"Terribly glitched. Items don't sync after the first time. Constantly freezes or gets stuck doing the same process over and over (like if you edit an item and try to save, it'll keep saving and get stuck and your only option is to close the app). It's barely usable for me so I'm just going to have to use the desktop site instead."
So great to be able to meege registeries and liink to individule prodict pages! Now I only need to give my guests one website.
TRASH! DOES NOT WORK!
When it asks for wedding date and i click next it suddenly closes.... Tried it many times changed the details but always on the date page just crashes
"Unreliable updating and recording of details (some gifts weren't marked as purchased, even though buyers had included their information), doesn't connect with some online stores (no pictures available, for example), invitations go straight to most junk mail boxes and are tricky to find retroactively as recipients didn't realise to search under My Registry rather than our names. Great in theory, but there are some big frustrations with this app."
"Too many errors. We scanned a few things at a store and were so jazzed about how easy it was but then nothing we scanned would register on the app and we had to manually add from the store's website. Couldn't get wayfair to sync properly. Tried to add items from wayfair but the registry would only link to wayfairs home page. The app is cool concept, but hard to use."
"Good idea but feels more complicated than needed. It can't find any details from Wayfair when I try to ""share"" the page of what I want. It just posts a generic photo from wayfair store and not a picture of the product I want listed to my registry, plus I still have to add in all the details myself. O haven't tried to add from any other shopping website yet."
"It does not work! We love the webpage and were so excited to use the app to add items in store. However, the app just doesn't work. It is so slow and keeps crashing. We were very disappointed!"
Such a handy app!! Easy to add from other apps/sites and allows me to manage my registry on the go!! Also very happy with the devs and how quickly they respond to and fix bugs.
"It worked great but suddenly it keeps crashing. I updated it, but still doesn't work."
For some reason it keeps shutting down as soon as I try to open it.
Really great for a while then I added something from etsy and now I can't get the app to open. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled twice.
"Glitchy, doesn't update. Will not sync Macy's and other stores. Did not disclose additional fees for cash funds until AFTER the account is created."
The app synced with everything really well when we first set up the registry. The app stops working with Costco and Macy's and Target registry. It does not show any of the most recent updates. The registry keeps sending updates that certain items are no longer sold and we cannot replace them in the website.
It will not open for me at all
"It's a very finicky app. When it works it's really great, but then occasionally it decides to forget who i am and start me all over again on creating a registry... Then it remembers who i am and we're back on track. It also doesn't sync perfectly - so a few times I've had items on my registry disappear and reappear on a later date. Some Amazon items don't show up. Despite the flaws I've found the app pretty helpful. It's not great but it's good."
Began crashing several times. Doesn't even get to main screen before crashing. Fix please!
The app hasn't worked since the last update. I'm dissatisfied with having to go online to manage my registries. I downloaded the app for the convenience. I've now just stopped using my registry all together and went to only Amazon registry.
It's ok. But it makes me.very uncomfortable that theirs random baby pictures when you load a gift onto your list.... Very uncomfortable
Too many glitches. Not user friendly. Made me go through a whole process of making a new registry every time I logged in. Also crashes way too many times.
Amazing people
"I was a little worried about using this app for our baby registry based on the bad reviews, but we haven't had any problems with it at all. It was easy to use both for me and for my friends buying gifts."
Its hard to use the registration
I'm using a Google pixel and cannot find any way to add a gift via barcode scanner.
The app keeps crashing. I can't even add any items to my baby registry how do I add items
Very cool way to have all registries in one place.
"App is cool. Customer service has been a big let down. I've contacted them 4 times about the same issue, which they cannot seem to fix and tell me they will get back to me, which they never do."
No to impressed so far
"It's works as described, it opens a separate browser window and has some issues but the app runs efficient otherwise"
"I spent hours adding gifts to my registry using the Add to Registry button. Each time, I received a confirmation. Yet, when I actually checked my registry, nothing had been added. A total waste of time."
"great app, worked well so far."
I just spent two hours making my list just for it all to disappear now I have to start over not happy
Why doesn't this work in landscape? It would be an appreciated feature
Horrible. This app is hot garbage. Great concept. Cant scan anything at any store we tried. Got a lot of bugs to work out. Wish Home Depot and other stores would dump this app and just do their own.
Couldn't add anything from best buy. Just tried to filter view a specific individual (as the family each has a list) and it wouldn't work. Said the person was selected but it still showed everyone else. I didn't have many issues in the past but lately it seems to not work as well.
"Okay for desktop. Doesn't work with smart phone. You can add the myregistry extension to your browser on a desktop but can't do it with a smart phone, and they dont have a way to upload a registry item via web URL, so I have to jump on my computer to add otems directly through websites using the extension. I wish they would either make the extension available on dmart phones or give me the option to add items via URL. Can't just add on the spot when I think of items I need."
"The Concept Is Amazing And Long Overdue. It Works Flawlessly With Some Websites. It Would Be Of Better Quality If The Images Were Available For Children's Place & Other Sites. Update: I Recieved $100 In My Cash Gift Fund A Week Ago. I Had To Wait For The Money To Be Transferred To My PayPal Account (5 Days It States But It Took Longer). When I Received It, They Only Gave Me $97.50. During This Pandemic & Having To Cancel My Baby Shower, I Need ALL Of MY MONEY! You People Are Disgusting!"
It's a great app no issues.
"It doesn't read non amazon pages that well, so I have to manually enter all the information which is fine but cant edit the url off an item and often the ' visit in store's link just takes you to the store main page rather than the specific item"
Awesome for weddings
"There's some wonky UX, and the program repeatedly makes me log in for some reason, even when I am actively using the app. It's okay-ish."
Worked fine till about 2 days ago. Now it won't load. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. It freezes my phone. Only way I can access is on the web not the app. Very disappointed
Completely baffles me that after years of using this app it has barely gotten any better. Why the heck can't you search other people's lists?! That functionality should have been in the initial release!
I cant even open the damn App. Zero stars
"Liked the old app hate the updates does not hold filters or sorting for a few seconds let alone between uses, for some reason the items bounce as you scroll which I hate"
"I created the registry online, then downloaded the app, now the app is not working. But I check the website online and my iteams are there but not showing on the app. Please help!"
"annoying that you have to login every time you open the app and there is not a ""stay logged in"" option. also with the new update the app us running extremely slow for me"
love it!
"The app doesn't even open for me. It started where whenever i would press log in but now it shuts down as soon as i open it and says ""app stopped working"" then gives you an option to close the app or send feedback. Do you even get the feedback?"
"upgraded yesterday and now the mobile app is not working. I click to open it, it opens and closes everytime. cant access anything"
"If It Would Open.... Every time I attempt to open this app, it stops working and will not open up. Highly disappointing."
"Before I could log in with my facebook, now it will force close when I try to log in. I can't access my registry. It's been this way for about 2 weeks. I guess since the update."
App works exactly as it should. I used it for my housewarming party and it was very easy to add items and for my guests to use.
Two faults with the app since using it over the past few days on Android. 1) when you select the currency then save it still comes up as USD and you have to go back into edit to select the right currency again 2) it doesn't pull through images like the desktop version does.
"Good, but... It would be better if: - the app kept you logged in. We shouldn't have to constantly re-log into myregistry... If I can constantly stay logged into my Gmail, I should be able to stay logged into my wish list. Why the added security? - the app allowed you to change your personal view rather than just your guest view. I always want to see my list by category, and I have to select it each time I log in."
the app is really frustrating to use. at times it refuses to add gifts to the registry or it doesn't incorporate the picture of the product. even after I changed the currency from the default dollar to rands the app reverts it back to dollars
"The idea behind it is great and I can add stuff from the UK BUT I have to log in every time I open the app! This needs to be fixed, it is not hard to write an app that keeps you logged in."
"Awful. Useless for Canada. It says you can sync any store registry... but for Canada there are only 4 stores you can sync...and guess what, the biggest/most popular Canadian ones are NOT SYNC-ABLE... I'm talking NO Babies R Us and NO SnuggleBugz!!! What a useless app. I knew this sounded too good to be true. On top of that, when I tried to contact them about this, I just got a failure notice back in my email....so terrible customer service on top of it all. :("
"The app constantly logs you out, even if you're consistently using it. Further, I cannot have it update with the most recent adds/deletions. I have force stopped the app, restarted my phone, etc. the only thing that seems to work is uninstalling and then reinstalling; it works for a short while after that. I've called customer service about the issie, and she had no fix either. I love the link to ""add to myregistry"" on a phone. I just wish the app was better at showing me what I was adding."
"Love the overall concept... from reading earlier reviews it sounds like the app is getting there in terms of functionality. It doesn't scan any items at Kohl's and they just announced that they are discontinuing their own registry, so this seems a high priority fix. Also it would be nice to be able to make some changes like categorization in bulk by marking check boxes and then changing once rather than clicking on each item it you forgot to do it the first time, or changed your categories."
"I don't understand why the website tells you how many gifts were purchased at the top of the main screen, but the app doesn't. Also, there should be a ""sync all registries"" button, instead of having to sync them all individually."
scan feature does not work at kohls?
"Won't sync my Amazon registry. The ""problems"" is says might cause it to not sync were taken care of and there is no chances."
"Logs me out every time I leave the app. Laggy interface, poorly designed."
Worked for a while then all of sudden when I try to click on anything it boots me out the whole app
"Downloaded app. Entered my due date and hit save, app changes my due date. No, that's not what I entered. I'll stick with Amazon."
"I love this app, however, I hate having to constantly sign in again! At least include a ""remember me"" button so we don't have to type our email and password every single time we want to add something to our registry please!"
"The service itself is AMAZING. The app, however, immediately closes on my phone even after an uninstall/reinstall and an update to my phone. Can't give the app anything above 1 star if I can't use it"
Worked for a bit but now closes every time I open it
App closes as soon as I try to open it. Perhaps it doesn't work with the Android 9 update?
"I love being able to compile all of my registries into one. You can choose 
how items are viewed by guests and it allows you to favorite items. It lags 
when it comes to notifying me of purchases made, but other than that I love 
it! Very convenient and you have several options to how to add items to the 
registry. I had to come back and edit my review bc after an update the 
personalization that was added to the registry was removed and I can't add 
it back bc now it's saying the pic has to be at least 200"
"Didn't transfer the prices (set them as $0.00) or pictures on many items - 
even from big sites like Amazon. Also can't figure out how to easily cancel 
my account."
"Not good for UK users. Whilst the idea of this is good and the app works 
well, it is not really good for non-US users. You can personalise it, but 
functionality is limited or long winded to do this. It's a shame as it has 
potential."
"It's a good idea in theory, but the function of it could be improved. I 
would like a option to change settings, including default currency; when I 
added stuff, I had to change the currency every single time. And then, 
after all that, when I went to the list on the app, the currency had 
reverted back to USD, so I had to change it again. It also seems like there 
could be an improvement on the amounts and types of information taken from 
the websites, as opposed to having to be entered manually (eg. the 
"
Easy to use
Freezes everytime I try to add things to my registry from browser.
Wont load app. Just stays on loading page but nothing happens
There's a glitch that won't let you sign in with Google.
Supper buggy lots of duplicates
Only one of the items on my registry is showing up and it is appearing 26 times. The website has all my items correctly listed but not the app.
"I *was* enjoying the app, until it started putting a buggy pop-up on the screen, asking if I was enjoying the app, that does nothing when I tap the buttons and won't disappear. I'm now enjoying the app less."
Right now it's pretty buggy and there are a ton of duplicates that I know aren't on the computer. Any guestimate on when this will be fixed?
This was the best way for my guests to see all of our gift wishes in one place.
Was great but with latest update lost almost everything I had saved. Useless if I have to re do everything if data is lost after updates.
"The website is great, but the app is lacking. I can't load new notifications properly (it lags) and since the latest update, one item shows up about 50 times on my list."
Scanner doesn't work.
Horrible
Love this app! We use it as a Christmas/birthday wishlist for the kids when our family across the country ask what they want. Everything gets shipped directly to us so they can avoid additional shipping costs. Super convenient.
Couldn't scan one item at World Market. The app doesn't work.
Great idea. Does not work. Scanner failed 90% of the time and pictures would not save.
"I have used this app the past two Christmas's and it was great, easy to use, and easy to upload items for my wish list. Now it just sits there loading. It's really disappointing."
"For the most part this app was really great! Easy to add items right from my phone to the registry, notifications were helpful for sure. The only thing I wish it had was a way to see the number of purchased vs unpurchased gifts- (as in the total count). I also had a hard time finding the ""guest book"" and messages that people left. Other than that it was perfect."
"Won't let me add items from other websites. Just sits there forever ""loading"". So what's the point?"
You open the app and all it does is stay one 1 screen. You can't do anything.
Clean and easy platform! Ditch the ads though.
Was working great suddenly it won't open.
"Great app, very easy to use!"
I used this last year and loved it.  I installed it on my new device and was having issues.  The updates have solved the problem.  Looking forward to using it this Holiday season again.  It made it so easy to add items from online and instore or catalogs.  I havent fully explored the updates but would love an easy way to make make multiple lists for family members that can be shared with one link.
This site used to be awesome. Now you can't successfully add gifts from your phone or computer. There is a major issue and it is highly annoying.
Pretty easy and fun!!
"This is the best way to make sure you can register for anything and everything you want! I have used other registries, and this is by far the most user-friendly. I also love that you can organize the list however you choose. I highly recommend this registry!"
"Any store, any item - my registry was perfectly us! Highly recommend for any occasion (even christmas lists)."
Doesn't let more than one person add items to the registry. Useless for us.
Easy to use love it
Easy to use
Great app
Great-love it!
"There's some thing wrong with the app. Everything on my list has the favorite on but when I go to Change it it says ""changing groupgift is not authorized"""
Would not open up It keep closing up every Time I tried Evening the app. Up...
All I get are ad notifications to enter sweepstakes. There is no setting feature to turn this off. I'm tired of these constant notifications so I am uninstalling this app.
Great
Love it
I wanted a registry that was aesthetically pleasing and that I could curate by item type this one has it all. appreciate the text message and email notifications and the fact that it keeps track of should buys what. I'm super impressed that older less save members of our friends and family were easily able to mark an item as purchased and pleased that you could add items from anywhere on the web.
"App won't open.  Just stays on intro screen, white with the logo in the middle.  Tried an uninstall/reinstall, nothing."
I love this to send out to family so they know what to get me but you should have a setting where you can't see if people got you something
"Worked great and then now it wont even let me add gifts. Everytime I am on a website and try to ""share"" so it goes on my registry, it says the app has stopped working...I am not happy!"
And needs work to be more user friendly.
"I found this website while setting up several wedding registries, thinking I whish I could find one place where I could show all of these. Now that we are expecting! I am back and I'm so happy it has an app now."
It's a great app! I think the more technologically inclined have an easier time of it though.
"I can't sync my store registries once I've made changes, and can't add a new one. The app is fine to glance over everything, but the sync feature doesn't seem to work."
"I have some really technology challenged family members. If they can use it anyone can. I read a lot of the comments about missing functionality. Honestly, every one of them must be even more technology challenged because the features they say are missing are available. For example deleting items or marking items as purchased in the app. People have been saying you have to go to the web site for those features. Not true."
For my grandson's 1st B - day!
"Adding an item using the share feature only worked the first time. When you try adding items, it will be in a loading stage for minutes and would freeze soon after. Poor quality app."
The only thing I don't get why you guys can't add a part in the app that you can add gifs online I have to go on my computer to add on gifts from web sites Sometimes some people do not have their computer on hand to add on gifts from websites to their registry. I do love the barcode part of the app so when you're in stores you can add on your stuff.
For the past 2 weeks I have been trying to use the app and it says communication error try again later.....but never works even Uninstaller and reinstall still not working
"I can't open the app anymore. It's giving me a service error every time and I've uninstalled and re installed, still errors out."
Only items on Walmart and target are on the list but nothing from baby's r us so i have to go to the website of that store to see what was purchased and it's not fun. I wish they can change that!
"I am very confused to why people are giving it 4 stars or less. The app is very easy to navigate and is just like the site. I am familiar with most technology, but even if I weren't, the app is easy to use and I'm so glad they updated it."
Does not update
"You should be able to remove items from your registry without logging into  the store.  For example,  I cannot access my Walmart wedding registry to delete duplicate items."
"I really like having all my registries in one place, however I feel like it could be much more user friendly - like being able to separate purchased from unpurchased right within the app instead of going to the desktop page."
Download.
"Won't install,"
"I keep getting an error message, cannot connect to server,please try again later."
I love the concept of this app but it doesn't really work the way it should. I can go to a website and share it to this app but once it's on there it doesn't show the picture of it. U have to highlight the website then Google it for it to come up. You should be able to click on the link and have it pop up.
"Changed my life. Seriously what dad or husband loves to shop? We go in get stuff and get out! Not anymore. With this app I am an organized shopping machine! Birthday list, Wedding list (Whoo hoo!) The app UI is perfect, you dont need a degree to use it. Cool Note: if you turn your GPS on while adding items the app will actually show you stores where the item is cheapest,  not just  where you're scanning the item"
This app is horrible! It won't focus on the Barcode worth crap and doesn't allow you to manual focus on the Barcode. Don't use this app it isn't work the time!!
It doesn't have an auto focus feature so it never actually scans....really disappointing.
"I am not sure why other users have experienced difficulty using this app; I am a computer neophyte and I managed to get this app up and running on both my computer and cell in seconds.  Put it this way, if you can brush your hair or tie a shoe, you can figure this app out. If not, than I do recommend repeating kindergarten.   That aside, this app is great! It has been so easy and fun to add items to  my registry. I do so with a simple click of a button from my browser toolbar, or the icon on my phone.  It r"
"I can't add the URL for the item, only the item details. This makes it absolutely useless for me. I want to be able to give the exact link that my family can use to buy the item."
"I've tried a lot of wishlist apps, and this is the only one that I find easy to use. And I love that I can add things from anywhere online."
"App was slurring fine before. After update, adding items now takes you out of the app which is a pain"
"Unless you have hours available to do this, don't bother. There has to be something easier."
I'd give no stars if I could since the app won't even open. I've uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times and it just won't open.
I downloaded this app so I could have all my baby registries together and it won't even load. I'm do frustrated.
Bar code scanner will not focus but everything else is fantastic
For my second baby I wanted a sprinkle not shower so there were very few things I needed and Def not all from same store. This is awesome I wish I found it first time around. Just have trouble adding things without going into actual site and doing it all as I would have with or without the app
This is app was just what my family has been looking for to manage and share our Christmas lists. We wanted something with a barcode scanner but also where you could search and add and take pictures to add. The only problem is that I tried to make a second wish list for my own use to save ideas for gifts I wanted to give others and now when I switch to it on the app it doesn't let me switch back to my own wishlist. I click on the dropdown list but it doesn't show any other options after the first switch.
"I downloaded the app on my phone. When I wanted to sync my registries, it said to use computer or tablet. Using the tablet, it says the same thing. What gives?"
Will not focus the barcodes. It took 50 minutes to scan 15 things and it's very inconvenient! Two thumbs down!!
I updated my target registry but it won't update on this app.
For real? Now we aren't going to get half our registry gifts and a bunch of stuff we decided we don't want will be ours? You need to fix this NOW!
Used as baby registry. I was able to add and delete items. Scan stuff in store and add online. This app made tracking purchases easier. I used it mostly to track what I was buying myself. Worked like a charm. I had no crashes and loved linking all my store registries.
Unable to change between registries or delete old registries or registry items. Redirected to website so what is the point of this app?
I use it for my wish list to keep track of things I want to buy. I also use their website.
Wedding
Trying to reinstall the app  it was working before system updates.
Using this because the store that has most of what i want doesnt have a registry. When i go to the store through the app the site doesnt work. Im i doing something wrong? Confused and frustrated
"Navigating using the browser seemed very slow. I decided to copy and paste links from Google chrome with little success. Pages would only half load, no information would show up when I'd click to add something to my registry. Most time I wait until I have access to a pc."
"UPDATE: All of the issues I experienced were resolved when I updated my phone.                             I set up my registry online with no problems. Online, I'd give it a 4 (I wish I could manually sort items and enter price ranges), but the app just crashes every time I try to open it."
It does what I need it to do. Possible improvement would be mobile browser integration and recognition of a copied url.
"Great app , but a lor of the pages wont load. Overstock and target pages will not show search results. Please fix"
Website works fine but can't add items from app at all. App crashes also. Both site and app would be better if you could manually re order items or have the sites with a categorized sort
5 stars for more privacy. Would appreciate not giving permission for camera & microphones... thnx
"I haven't been able to add one item from website, picture or scanned barcode. Uninstalling to try another one that will work. I'm using Samsung Galaxy S5."
"Nice idea, excellent app. Keep up the good work!"
Need the option to sort. Also if an image was updated via web it doesn't get refreshed in this app. You have to clear the app's cache manually to fix the issue.
Either for a baby shower or wedding . Very helpful!
"This is God awful. Who made this, a 4 year old on meth?"
The scanner doesn't work and every time I try to add an item in any way it freezes. Please fix! I would desperately love to be able to just scan barcodes and add things to my registry. =\
"The update fixed the crash issue, but the browser us still crap. Plus, when adding, even from a store listed, the photo isn't displayed on my list. Gonna have to stick with the website til they fix this app right."
I love that there's an app for this but it sucks that it keeps crashing when I try adding items to my list. Please fix this issue ASAP.
Seems nicer. The mobile site actually feels like an app too.
I really like that I can add a gift just by sharing a URL to the app when I'm surfing the web. I also like the section where you can see what other members are adding.... I scroll thru it a lot to find ideas
This app was a life saver. I had to choose a gift for a wedding and this app gave me the best suggestions and options. The community section helped me a lot. Design was amazing.
I love this app. This is a cool way to add my gift-list and share with my friends and family. I especially loved the baby-store and wedding store options. Please keep adding more.
A great app to track what Gifts I need to get for my family.. especially for my Grandkids. Thanks for the cool app.
This version is fast and just seems to work a lot better.
Not compatible with etsy very complicated
"It could be a good app if it didn't pop up like you were viewing a mobile website. Needs to be more like a Web independent app. At this point, might as well unintelligible the app and just view the page via mobile Web."
Really like this app and my family is using it however just found out you can't view categories from the mobile apps even though you can from the website. Tech support says you have to go to full website on your mobile phone to do that and everyone knows that's a pain dealing with a website that is not formatted for mobile use..  So bottom line you have to leave app and go to their website to view items in your registry by category. Seems pretty silly to me
All this app contains is a link to their mobile site which launches in your browser app... No point in having an app that launches another.  Create an actual app with its own interface and I might redownload...
"In theory I love the idea of my registry, and used it for our wedding. But it's riddled with bugs, especially this app and their mobile site. The app just sends you to their mobile site, and I couldn't even log in since it would just launch a video after I entered my email and password."
"This app is a good idea, if it worked.  Have to see registry on web, but can only see for literally 2 seconds. A pop up window comes up to say to save site as a bookmark and save to home page. I did that and it I still can't see my registry. App should work as an app, not a web page.  Developers should check out the GoodReads app and get some tips.  It is very user friendly.  Please fix!!!!!!  I really like the service on the computer, but app needs A LOT of work."
"One of the main reasons I downloaded this is so that I could use Etsy with it. Doesnt register the right pictures and you cant ""share"" things from Etsy to my registry. Pretty lame."
"There's no point to this app, it just automatically brings you to the website. If I wanted to use the website, I'd go there in the first place. Also, no way to manage registry from the mobile site. Major fail!"
"This ""app"" just takes you to their web page. Why waste space on your phone with that?"
Needs to be further developed. Takes you to the website when you scan a barcode. Should be added by the app.
"First, annoyed it takes me to the web, not an app. Then, it won't allow me to login on the web as it only wants to show the video on the home page when I push login. Please fix so I can utilize this app!!"
"If the app just takes you to a browser, what's the point?  Uninstalled"
"Galaxy S 2. Went on to check baby registery and was hoping to change the guest setting, but mobile does not have that option. Also synced store with babies r us on home computer, but do not see that list on mobile or an option with URL to view on a browser. I gave above average because of the poor ratings this app was already receiving. Its really not that bad."
I hate the new update. I don't want to go on the Web to see my registry! It was far simpler and useful the way it was before.
Logs me out 10 seconds after I log in every time. Not really an app. Just a shortcut to the mobile site. Uninstalling.
"I downloaded this app for the barcode scan feature as it makes the idea behind the whole site that much more awesome... But it doesn't work well. I tested it out on one product and two out of the three times it said it could not add gift to my registry, but the third time it did. And that was when I could get the button on the app to respond. Had to close out and open back up again... So some room for improvement perhaps."
"This refresh seems light, and but overall experience is better"
Logs me out  a few seconds of logging in on my LG Revolution. Cant even look at my registry.
This is a really crappy app...please improve!
Love the site. Cannot log in on my samsung galaxy s vibrant
Would be great if I could actually use it
Limited abilities
"Cant even log in, the app is totally useless in this state. I should have tried the app before setting up our registry, I would have used another service.  Atrix 4g."
"You can scan stuff in a store - that's about the only reason to get this.  If you want to add gifts on an Android device by finding it online, this doesn't help.  I haven't figured out a way to make the browser button work on Android so this app doesn't help."
This app is amazing! I have a wedding registry and this made everything so much easier!!!
I can't view any of my items thru app. It will give the number of items but if u follow thru it will say no results found. Frustrating.
Please fix the list retrieving problem. Can't see my registry items.
"I registered online through Facebook.  Had no clue what my password was.  Had to have it emailed to me so I could log into the app.  Come to find out it's 36 characters long of symbols, numbers & letters.   How is one supposed to type all of that into their phone?  But, I did it. I tried changing the password to something a tad bit shorter...but the site would not let me.  Then I can't keep the app open more than 1 minute before it crashes.     Tried searching the app for my registry, but it says it can't f"
"App works, had problem logging in, changed input method from swype to multi touch keyboard. Problem solved. Droid X"
"This app sux.  It can't pull up a registry I know is there.  It shows the registry, but it's empty.  Useless"
Needs URL adding... Only way to add stuff is UPC or barcode scanning. How useless is that when you find something (most things) via the internet?
My user name is my email. It's clears out what I entered once I get to the end of the box. Fix the log in problem.
"So far the app works great! No login issues like other comments said (honestly I was worried about that). Pages all load pretty quickly. Easy to use, nicely laid out. HTC EVO4G"
That is a sure downer.
Worked as advertised on first attempt. No login issues. Syncs with our list and is pretty slick.
"Good when working. Lately when  I login, doesn't show me items  on my baby registry. Frustrating. UnInstalling n reinstalling to c if it works then"
Forced closed before I Could do anything. Samsung Charge.
"I don't know what the others are talking about. So far, this app works fantastic for me. Running on Droid 2"
It is the worst you can't sign in or look at anything I want to shoot myself in the face just for having experienced such a horror
FIX THE LOGGING IN PROBLEM.  THE WEB SITE IS AWESOME BUT THE APP *$%&@
It won't let me log in...please fix it..this would be such a great app for me...FIX IT
Website is good. App is not. Nothing I scan has been in the database.
Didn't log in
I <3 the website but app wont let me log in. This sucks! Fix & ill use it & give a better rating.1st moto Droid.
Never lets you log in. Horrible app.
Works great for me.
It would be a zero star since I can't even login.
"Horrid, simply horrid, I can't login, can't find my registry....would be great if it worked!"
Wont even let me log in
Can't login anymore. Visitor PW doesn't work either.
Nice
Works good. didnt need wi-fi. Just scan barcodes for items i want. If u want to remove an item its better to do it online. Phone got glitchy.DROID
"App only works on WiFi, kind of dumb idea since ive never been in a store with WiFi. I Will give 4 stars if i could use this on 3g/4g network."
Lame!
"Would be infinitely better if usable over phone network... not just wireless. Not all stores have wifi available. Other than that, great app."
"Works on wifi, but has all the other issues mentioned when not connected to a wifi network, which defeats the purpose. Great concept, please fix!"
S*cks!
This app does not let me login in on my Verizon Droid....
"This app will not work on mytouch 3g. It will not let me log on, find a registry, or scan in barcodes."
Does not work on a my touch 4g phone.
"I have a 3g slide and the same complaints as edgar. Can't log in or find my registry. Useless app, kind of a bummer :-/"
Wont work with my mytouch 4g...doesnt even find my registry or let me log in...would be a cool app if it worked
"Wont show more than 3 gifts from registry. Love the site and idea of app, just needs a bit more tweaking."
"Update: Good at adding online but always shows ""no gifts"" on cell app. Using g2. So disappointed!!!"
No matter how many times I try it doesn't let me sign in with my user name and password I created on the website... time to uninstall
Wont let me add stores I like or do some other features
"Requires email registration, forces closes when I try to scan an item without doing this."
The most amazing app around. It is so addicting. I scan and add stuff to my gift list. I'm so glad it's available for Android now.
