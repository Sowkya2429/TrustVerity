0,Very nice. I love this app. As a fandom there are so many fanfiction to read .
1,"It's great, but you can't put pictures in your stories without them moving and covering up the words, and you can't move it back. Also, when you use italics or something like that, sometimes it turns the whole story into italics, or whatever you're using."
2,Good one
3,"This app was amazing when I first tried it out and I loved using it, but now with all the useless updates and bugs it's hard to even use the app anymore. Ranging from ads after almost every chapter, to not being able to see when others respond to your comments, to books being taken down literally WHILE you're reading them. Just yesterday I was scrolling through my library and it was all fine, then I click on the app again today and almost my ENTIRE library is gone?! Absolutely ridiculous"
4,Ok the last bug I reported got fixed thanks for that‚ù§ but wattpad is acting up again.... It is not allowing me to read paid stories offline neither is it allowing me to read the offline downloaded ones.... üíîüòü
5,Lots of good books
6,This app used to be good one now it's totally flooded with ads only Ads are ok but in moderate manner There are 45 sec ads after every chapter
7,Cool
8,I think the app should be more advertised. I feel like people should be reading and writing more stories. They‚Äôre just helpful and therapeutic in a way I can see.
9,"This is an amazing app. I read and write all the time! But before I downloaded the app, I used the website. The website had no ads which I think is weird. It should have ads instead, making you want to download the app for no ads. I would give this a 4.5, but it's I can't, and it's not good for a perfect 5 stars. Keep working and adding things!"
10,This app is so nice because Wattpad is help me to relax if I'm so stressed from school ‚ù§Ô∏è
11,"i was editing my story and then i just went to open another app to search for something, and when i came back, the app restarted. what's even worse is that when i was about so reopen the chapter i was editing, all the changes that have been made weren't saved. and the WORST part is that the revision history wont let me f-ing load the previously saved draft. FIX THIS I VEG YOU."
12,What happened to the app? I cant load anything with the most recent update! My conmection is fine. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled a million times. The problem still exists!
13,Good
14,It doesn't let me change my username please fix that
15,"I love it but just one problem, when I put the pictures in my book, it won't appear when I publish it. And when i click kn a font to use, it would cover the entire text of the chapter in the same font aswell, plus it is super laggy and is always telling me to click on a version of the chapter to save since it glitches or something and doesn't save the chapter. It keeps sending the texts to the middle of the page when i want to make it to the right. Please fix these issues, and thanks"
16,Good
17,I have been using wattpad for about 2 years now and everything was fine at first but whenever I add images images my chapters the images somehow disappear from the chapter after a few days. Im also having a hard time typing since yesterday the typing won't load and the app freezes up a lot. I hope this gets fixed.
18,"If you would attach the possibility of adding an audio file when writing, it would be fun that I add songs to the appropriate events in the story that I writeÿå I will raise the rating to 5 stars when you add this feature, which will improve the program a lot"
19,"What the hell Wattpad? I always have dark mode on while I read, but now since I've updated the app, dark mode no longer works while reading! I can't read at night anymore because the FORCED light mode while reading hurts my eyes. Again, what the hell, Wattpad? You guys are too money-hungry, I swear to GOD. Too many ads! If these are fixed/changed I'll consider a better review."
20,Absolutely love this app.
21,We can save 25 books offline right? But at once it becomes only two and again in another week it becomes 25...Is it just for me? I thought of buying premium but still can y'all fix this for me?
22,I like reading.So I Like this
23,My internet is terrible üíÄüíÄ
24,The best app ever!It has some amazing relateble stories OMG!!!!!!!!!
25,"Its still great and all but i dont like the new update the much, the synopsis font was way too small yeah it looks classy but not that convenient, and it takes way too long to load a story before you saw the synopsis even though the data and wifi were doing fine and its not the signal's problem"
26,"I absolutely love the app, but it wont let me sign in, whenever i do it says try laterüíî"
27,"Truly, there are no words its wonderful, yes there are adds but its worth cause of stories and u know I have also improved my english"
28,This app won't allow me to change my username and because of this app I was hacked twice
29,"lol, what's wrong with this. why all my password has declined."
30,"This is the worst app I have ever installed on my device. I kept on putting in my email address AND IT WAS CORRECT but the app kept on saying that it's invalid. I downloaded this thinking it'd be a great app for me to write stories on, but guess what? I can't even get into the app. Worst app ever, I am uninstalling this app right now. I am never going to download this ever again."
31,I Like
32,Don't install this app. They are selling your privacy data
33,Pakitanggal nalang po ng paid stories hehe
34,"There's something wrong with wattpad... I can't add more than 2 stories in my offline list, and that's really making me upset."
35,It showing that my offline limit is 2 out of 2. I am so angry of this üòû
36,Good
37,"It's a great app & I've really enjoyed writing on it , but since some days my story's parts are getting messed up , the lining of the numbers of chapters are getting messed up & the amount of chapters is messed up too , hope you guys will fix this problem ."
38,"The app was good until the new update, it won't even let me sign into my main accounts anymore, it says that the username or password is wrong, but when I search up my accounts on Wattpad they're still there."
39,"God, wattpad isn't like before üò§"
40,So good
41,Memories of the past filled with dark moments I'm going back to it to see my mistakes I'll rate this as 5 stars for now Unless I change my mind.
42,"The app is really great, but since yesterday I can‚Äôt read novels when I want to read it says there is no internet connection but I already have internet I‚Äôm facing this problem from yesterday also today I can‚Äôt log in to the app nothing works inside the app it shows I‚Äôm not connected to the internet but I have internet, so why doesn't it work, I will give it a star only now, and when the problem is solved, then I will give it 5 stars"
43,I would like to think that it's a nyc reading app
44,"Never felt so annoyed using an app before, you update and update trying to ""improve"" the visuals, but EVERYTHING gets worse. First, it ALWAYS changes the layout or format I Placed and when I preview my work IT ALWAYS CHANGES. there's a reason, i put THAT certain layout. And another thing, i absolutely HATE the new visuals of this app, the previous one, is waaay better than those. I am beyond disappointed on where this app had gone from."
45,Okkk
46,Life
47,Grbe hirap gumawa ng acc.
48,"Even if any story is fully uploaded in this app, the next chapters are not shown, so that I cannot read the next story. please fix this problem soon"
49,"The best among the rest, my stress reliever forever"
50,"Hi, wattpad is not working from 2 days . The app is not opening at all. Tried ubinstalling and reinstalling but still the same problem"
51,Its a good app but recently when i open this one story it shows this story got lost..... What should i do.... Btw its in one of my offline stories
52,"Amazing, I really love it. This app really makes my day"
53,I love this app so much
54,"Good experience,love it...."
55,super nice to read
56,having to relog every time you open the app is annoying
57,Too much ads
58,"La aplicaci√≥n es perfecta, excepto por dos aspectos: 1. HAY ANUNCIOS MIENTRAS LEES 2. ¬øPara que implementar las historias pagadas? Eso arruina totalmente el concepto de aplicacion gratis y de libre acceso. Me gustaria que eliminaran estos dos aspectos de la aplicaci√≥n, obstruyen la lectura c√≥moda y son bastante molestos. Adem√°s, la gente hace sus historias para el entretenimiento, no para la remuneraci√≥n econ√≥mica."
59,Very nice
60,Love the app but recently its been asking for a relogin EVERY TIME I use it online but works offline now I can access it at all! Please fix this!
61,its about a meh
62,Good for know
63,"The only good thing about wappad is the easy to use-ness. But I uninstalled the app. The amount of ads is obnoxious, I'm just trying to read and every. Single. Page. Theres an ad. Super annoying, would not reccomend. Find a diffrent app to all you fanfic lovers out there.üò≠"
64,"I used to love this app, then they started doing paid stories where you could pay for the entire story which I was fine with! Now you have to pay for each chapter (after so many chapters) even for books that I previously paid for, so now I have to pay AGAIN. Like what the heck?"
65,It keeps saying that it is not working even though it's been updated. It works on my other devices.
66,It should have a highlight feature
67,Dark mode and horizontal reading aren't working on tablets
68,It's good but when I try to read something and I scroll down I would get an app that wants me to download it so please fix that thank you
69,This updated Wattpad sucks
70,Love ut
71,"Puedo soportar anuncios pero no los que me distraen mientras leo, los anuncios dentro de cada cap√≠tulo son insoportables y el sistema de historias similares rara vez recomienda algo simiar a lo que se est√° leyendo, aparte se est√° atorando demaciado, en este punto preferir√≠a leer en otro sitio"
72,"Does it have a dark mode that i dont know or does it really dont have any dark mode ? If it doesnt i need a dark more fr, my phone looks like a torch in light mode when im reading at 3 a.m."
73,It was the best expirence ever in my life. Thanks for the chance of expensive
74,"Hello so a couple of days ago I was changing my username and your app needed me to type my password in while changing my username why do I have to type my password while changing my username I tried to do it. And it doesn't work. Also this morning, I was texting my friend about a dream I had a few hours ago, and I send the message with missing words I got mad because I know I can't delete my Text message from your app. I think your wattpad Dm system needs a delete button for text messages."

81,Good good good good good
82,very very bad
83,Magnific
84,good
85,This app is great but it would be better if we would be able to classify our books into folders to be able to search a specific book again
86,Being on this app isn't that fun anymore. To many annoying ads and when I tried to add pictures to my work it kept ruining the format. When I tried to upload a chapter it said error with wifi but ever other app worked perfectly fine. Not to mention writing a story on Wattpad without a laptop is a complete chore. Get better Wattpad.
87,"There was a lot of good stories that are paid stories so it kinda sucks a little. Also, is it just mine that says (for example) 14/25 in the offline stories but is actually just 13? You're making me doubt my counting skills so, please fix that. Anyway, there's a lot to complain about but the others probably already said it so I'm not going to repeat them. In any case, I'ma give this a four star because I've been with Wattpad for 6 years and I'm familiar with it."

89,"when a user opens a notification for a reply to their comment they should automatically be brought to that comment, not the page in the book."

95,"The app is great, until you reach the unnecessary amount of ads, I was fine with one after reading 2 or 3 chapters, but it's just gotten crazy, ad at the bottom of the screen, in-between the chapters with out a video, once you were able to find other books to read in between them but now you just get ads. The app has started to become un user friendly with the amount of ads that are cramped into it."
96,"IT DIDN'T EVEN LET ME IN WHAT DO YOU WANT JEEZ LORD ALL IT WANT IS MY PAST ACCOUNT I DON'T EVEN KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE NEW ACCOUNT BUT IT KEEP TELLING ME ABOUT MY PAST ACCOUNT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE NEW UPDATE"
97,This is a very good app for reading stories but I am having problems in my comments whenever I get a notification of a comment and I click in it it doesn't open my comment which I typed but instead show the story and I have to find it myself
98,this is not appropriate for kids and it has stories that are not suitable for minors like Aimee Joy Esique Perez
99,"I love this app, but recently I feel so frustrated using this. I keep on refreshing, uninstalling and installing the app and the result is still the same. I always lost my favorite books that's added to the offline stories and it keep on saying that ""the story is lost or broken."" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠"
100,The stories are sooo good
101,It one of my best novel apps and it being keeping entertained for years now.....I don't really have a problem with the app
102,"There is a problem..When I receive a notification that someone has replied to a comment of mine, and I click on the notification, the reply doesn't appear to me..I have to search for the comment myself to see what he replied to me! This is annoying The old Wattpad was better."
103,i doesn't like that the option for the offline is just at max is 2. what happened with wattpad these days? bring back the 25 offline stories
104,It's a good app but do have some stuff I would like Wattpad to add like for some chapter some authors would want to add like a song for the moon and right now you have it out in a yt video and you can't scroll down because then you can't play the video so instead how about you put like something from Spotify like how you put the text to speech like tumbler and you could scroll and the music would stooo once you are done with the chapter
105,Good app
106,Love it but I hate this one tiktok ad every time it pops up I can't get it off I have to leave the app completely and It keeps popping up after I just had to leave the app please fixs this its really annoying
107,Excelente que hayan agregado advertencias sobre ciertos contenidos. Excellent! ‚ÄòConsent is important' is a really good warning.
108,"I love Wattpad! That's how I discovered my love for writing. I'm an upcoming teenage author. However, when feeding my inner child with fanfictions, I cannot leave my pictures saved because they will disappear and reappear on top of one another, which is pretty frustrating when you're creating a plot to a story because you have to keep editing and redoing the same thing perpetually. It costs one star, unfortunately."
109,I love this app! The only problem is that that it has for some reaons stoped sending me notifications. I don't know why cause I tried everything. Notifications are allowed any nothing seems to be stoping it I cheaked the page this app has to see if it was a problem on the app's/website's end but it doesn't seem like it. If you guys could please figure out why this app has not been sending me notifications I would love that. Thank you.
110,This app is not opening in my mobile I don't know why it doesn't work in my android phone
111,"I've been using this app for 7 years, and I have the ad free version. Everything's great. What I hate is when I'm on the last page of a chapter and the next chapter has a video in the beginning, and that video starts playing before I even get to that page. I don't want it playing in general unless I play it myself, but it's an annoying inconvenience to be finishing a chapter, and all of a sudden, music/audio starts playing, completely ruining the flow of how I was reading and the book in general"
112,"Someone needs to take my phone away from me, I'm addicted."
113,"I am about to be done with this app, hate is a strong word but, I have come to hate what wattpad has become, many reasons why many persons have left, the many ads was one but that tolerable, but for me to find out that my wattpad offline stories limit decreased drastically from 25 of 25 stories to 2 of 2, what am I to do with 2 stories in my offline reading list, do you understand the amount of book I have read on this app, for 9 years I have been on this app."
114,I LOVEEEE Wattpad but man really you changed the free offline space from 25 to 2 y'all were doing really great until this.... And yes I don't use money so please if you could change it back that would be nice.
115,Im traumatized by my living nightmare abt tokio hotel.
116,Honestly getting tired of the type of ads I get; usually repulsive stuff. I don't even mind ads I just wish they could be less explicit or at the least curated to me
117,Amazing app
118,Great but now we gotta pay to have more offline stories üëç
119,Amazing!
120,"The stories you can download are decreasing and I woke up one day to only 2 of my 25 stories left and honestly the previous versions were way better than the new ones. Now I can't even open my account anymore, I just downloaded this on a new phone and it won't open anymore, ut just kept saying that there's a problem and to try again later when I have been trying for so long"
121,"Ich liebe Wattpad, aber seit kurzem, wenn ich nach einem Buch suche,omnt immer, dass es keine Ergebnisse bei dieser Suche gibt. Ich habe es schon deinstalliert und wieder installiert, aber das Problem geht nicht weg es kommt immer wieder. Ich muss ab und zu raus und wieder rein samt es einigerma√üen geht. Wenn ich die Filter verwenden m√∂chte, kommt das Problem wieder. Darum nur 2 Sterne. Fr√ºher war es um weiten besser als diese Version nach dem Update."
122,Hi I've been using this app for very long time and they shut me out of my other account I made and I'm back with my old account and I don't like it I'm giving it a one-star because it's gotten bad over the years

135,App is all good but too many ad's! It's disturbs a lot while reading! I would like story related pic's also to be downloaded when I'm downloading that story in offline read
136,Goodd
137,I love the app but the premuim and ads tho..Its normal for apps to have ads sooo ok...
138,"A good app for burgeoning writers. It provides many tools for digitally publishing a story, including media embedding. Message other users directly, read and catalogue their works, and follow their progress. That said, the app has serious flaws. Lately, ads have been preventing the use of my Google keyboard entirely, or just its Swype feature, making leaving inline comments a chore. Good idea for an app, but overall only par execution."
139,may bug po ba? nabubura kasi yung mga chapters na sinulat ko. bawal na bang magsulat ng offline? do something pls

165,"I've been using this app for about 3 years now. I do not like the new update and what they did with the table of contents. Also when I click on someone who replied to my comment and doesn't show me the comment, it just takes me to the chapter where I placed the comment."
166,"The app is amazing and all BUT you have to remove the expiration thing..I nearly had a heartattack because of it...please remove it...I don't remember my wattpad password and there's no way to change it for me since I'd need my OLD password but how can I change it if I don't remember my OLD password... that's all I want fixed, expiration removed please."

I'm just wanting to know if anyone is struggling with the same thing cause this is really frustrating. Please fix this issue Wattpad
172,I absolutely love wattpad I've been reading on it for years... But there has recently been some issues where when I try to add a book to one of my many reading list only one reading list pops up and it is honestly upsetting because I like my books organized in their own category üòî

180,"I love the app, and I have it on my phone and my computer. The app works great! The only thing is that when I update from my computer, it works. Then when I have my phone and use that, all the text is bold, and the app moves really slow."
181,Only 2 offline books is not enough. Wattpad really needs to go back to old ways.
182,"We used to have limitless offline stories, then 25 now you've left us with only two?!!! Bring back the 25 And please restore deleted stories that weren't deleted by the authors ( as a victim of such ) its not right to spend all that effort on a book and have it gone the second you try to write a new chapter Consider this please"
183,Not as good as it used to be
184,My experience is awesome‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
185,"It wants all of your personal info E.g. : Address, phone, contacts e.t.c"
186,I love this app. It's easy to use and navigate.
187,Great app
188,This app is nice
189,"I really like the app and all the stories it has, its really fun. You can find all book genres. I really recommend it."
190,It's great for reading and I've had a good experience with writing but if I get logged out I can't get back in unless it's on the website and the website takes me to the app when I try and then the app tells me to log in with my username and password but I do both and it doesn't work but my email and password do work.itd be nice if on the app thare was a email option to log in on the app.
191,"I have reached the limit in offline stories, which is not the first time. But suddenly out of nowhere I opened the app and found all my offline stories _except two idk why_ returned to the library which means returned to be online stories. And when I wanna download them again it says 'you reached your limit!' So is the limit now just two stories?"
192,It's üëé
193,Nice app
194,Very nice app
195,Good one
196,"Good app been using it for years but it refuses to open, it'll try and lauch but it just boots me back to my home screen please fix"
197,didn't work for me. don't like it.
198,"The rest is okay, but why is the message glitching whenever I message a fellow Wattpad user? Can you fix it?"
199,"I'm using Wattpad from almost 2 years, it has best novels"
200,Comfort zone my home!!!
201,It's really hard to find appealing books because of the search tool. I wish there was a better way to filter books and find good reads. The comments also glitch sometimes which is irritating.
202,I've been using Wattpad for 2 years now and I love the stories there but recently I am having some problems like: 1. In the offline reading list it says I can only add 2 stories while in my other devices I can still add upto 25 stories. 2. I can't find some stories that I had in my reading list. 3. There are too many ads. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this still can't seem to solve the issue... Please try to fix this issue ASAP. Thank you.
203,"This is all is great! But there is one problem. Whenever I save a story to library or download it and exit the app, the next time I open the app the story is not there. This has happened quite a lot of times. I have been able to find some of the stories that I lost but most of the times it's gone."
204,The app is not opening for me from yesterday as it is saying clear the history... I can clear history when i can open the app na .. plz look into it
205,it's disgusting
206,Best sangat baca dekat app ni
207,I don't know what happened but it took a lot of time just to show my library and archive. I also can't download until 25. It takes a long time just to open the app in offline when i definitely saved some stories in.
208,The app is good and i enjoy it very much..the only downfall is that when i try and search a specific title of a story..the ones that showed up are not what i specifically searched for..also the section where it shows 'more like this' there it literally showed the opposite of the likes of the story i was reading.But overall i enjoyed this app i just hope the problems im experiencing can be solved
209,Salamat
210,i can‚Äôt open anything‚Äö there‚Äôs always an error. i‚Äôve tried every way i can think to solve the problem but i still can't!!!
211,"This app is great. I would have liked to rate it five stars but there are problem. I can't save the story to read it offline, that is my only problem, I hope you can fix it"
212,"I give 5 start to this app! Since I'm a wattpader, neither a Reader nor Writer. It's a great app! And I'm sure everyone will like it too especially to those likes books!"
213,I love this app because I can read many fictions. But one thing I don't like about the app is very hard to login. Now I'm in that problem too. It's really disappointed
214,So good app
215,love it.
216,Nice c
217,Great app but it keeps saying my internet is off üò≠ when it's not off and alot of times I can't login when I deleted to make it work again but other then that it's so easy to find and read stories and to write them is also so easy over all I do love this app ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
218,A great app for the readers as well for the authors too ..... Giving everyone a chance to experience to be an author in this platform ....even if u write it for passion or anything ...

222,"Wattpad is now glitching with the notifications, whenever I clicked on a notification of a comment reply, it would bring me to the book chapter where I made my reply, but doesn't open up the comments tab, making me search through hundreds of comments to find mine."
223,"Love reading and writting but the ads are very stupid, most of the time they don't load so I have to close out of the app. They need to fix this because it is very annoying when I'm trying to read and I get an ad and it doesn't load."
224,I'm using this app since 2020 and it's given me the best service
225,Fun

228,Bro what is up with Wattpad for the post week it ain't working it keeps saying it has a problem connectong but everything is in its place it's soo annoying
229,Good
230,"I love the app so much but each time I get an ad after reading a story it's just blank and I can't get back to the story so I have to exit out of the app and open it up again. It's annoying, especially when you have to do it constantly."
231,"Its a great app I've been using it for maybe 5 years now? Great book collection can go over forty. Gives you the option to see a paying books preview before buying it. Gives free ability to filter tags (in case you don't like a certain genre like romance or something). You have the ability to edit your acc greatly. There's basically any story you want, its on there!"
232,"This app is amazing! All I can say though, is when your looking for a specific book or an author, it's a tad difficult to locate. There's nothing else wrong with the app except for that tiny detail. Thank you, creators of Wattpad, for creating such an amazing and wonderful app!!! One problem, why does the app say that my time on the app expired? I do not think i paid for anything on the app."

238,"I love wattpad, I'm join in 2021."
239,Tf
240,Ao3 is better.
241,Amazing
242,App is lovely. Unfortunately I can no longer write my chapters like before. I try to upload photos and format it a certain way for the story. But no photos pop up or they mess up the entire format. It's a struggle for several writers. Hopefully it gets fixed soon otherwise I might delete the app.
243,i loooovvvvvvvveee this app
244,"I've been using Wattpad for a while and it was really nice and easy to get the hang of. My only problem is the ad at the bottom of the screen on stories. When I'm reading, it's hard to focus because of the ad down at the bottom. I hope you do something about this and not just promote your Wattpad premium more"
245,"The app is overall nice. But, sometimes the app takes so much time to load the library. I have checked the data connection, my other data-using apps work good without buffering, network is strong, yet the app takes eternity to even load the offline books. Edit (i decreased a star rate): the app doesn't load the library, and closes on its own after a minute or so. I tried reopening the app thrice, only to repeat the whole loading and closing cycle."
246,We need After Dark wattpad back
247,"Constantly shoves romance in your face. Can't block all of the tags, nono, that's impossible! We HAVE to have a blocked tag limit or we die! Just get rid of the blocked tag limit already."

249,"I have used thus app for over 2 years but I don't know what happened to this app now it didn't even open and keep glitching. This app is my favorite app to reads books . I think there is a bug in the app, hope you try to fix this problem!!!!!"

254,"Please make some update that we can recovery our story that already deleted permanent, It made me sad because I accidentally deleted my story and I cant recovery it back...., Pls I'm begging to the developer"
255,The first time I actually started love reading was when I used Wattpad and I love how theirs other fanfiction books of my dreams there! I find Wattpad my comforter because whenever I read a book on Wattpad or read a comment it just brings a smile to my face!
256,It's really gud but I think adds are too much I mean there's no prob but giving adds after every 2 chapters is irritating...it would be gud if u give adds for every 5 chapters rather than 2 !!
257,"Yes! I rated this now 5 star as it finally updated back to 25 books, although it's nowhere near as the wattpad in the past where unlimited book is, this is already good enough, so.. gooddddd! I like this very much!"
258,"The app is great. You can read stories for free and even write your own. One suggestion I have is that there could be an option to delete certain notifications, like story updates etc."
259,"Most loved, but I wish wattpad introduces an automatic feature for story publishing. Like what YouTube has for premier scheduling, it will be super awesome to be able to plan a whole book, chapter scheduling routine, not to worry to forget to publish as one promised their wattpad fans, think of this, please, please, please..."
260,I love it.üñ§
261,Aaaaaaaaaaah
262,"It's okey I find happiness while using this app, and also I can say that it's a stress reliever for me who's addicted to this app."
263,Just reading without interrupting what can be better
264,"The best app ever üòÅ I've been catching up with the updates & sometimes I loose interest in continue reading ü§® too many ads and I just hate that.... ""PUNISHED BY HIS LOVE"" is the main novel I am giving 5 stars here. I hope the author update the story on a daily basis ü§£üòÇ am dying with imagination üôâüòÅü§£ü§£üòÇ"
265,It's just great app
266,"I really love this app, but since this year two profiles of my friends got removed without warning. Also stories that have a mature warning get removed without any notification or explanation why. The next point is that books i have achieved or in my Library got removed without telling me. I had over 400 books in my library and now there are only 200 left. There is no limit on how many books I can have in my library and achieved. An explanation why they got removed would also be nice."
267,It's a good app. I read as many as I want but there going problems in wattapad its not opening. Please fix it.
268,"I really enjoy using this app. I use it everyday and I've only found one problem with it. Sometimes when I go to write, the app will keep crashing. It's not frequently or even once a week, but it does happen. That is the only problem. Love the app and I really recommend it to people who are reader and/or writers!"
269,I LOVE this app I made so many friends and theyvare the best also live the stories in this I mostly read dnf (dreamNotFound) it's gayüíÖ‚ú® I love this app so much and if you like reading gay stuff straight stuff or wierd stuff you sound download this :))
270,SO MUCH FUN
271,"I have been using this app since 2017(probably longer)! Great app! However recently Wattpad has been getting rid of books that have been labeled mature and it sucks because alot of my most favorite books are rated mature. Secondly not only is there a limit on how many library folders you can make there's no way to make them more organized to any specific detail. Ex. You can't stick a folder inside a folder, etc."
272,"A great app to write stories but doesn't care about its users or actully fixes issues in updates like it says. If your trying to write a whole part at 1 time or need to look something up especially if you don't plan out ideas make sure its saved first by going back to the ""parts"" page or the app might crash with you and you loose the whole part, it's happened to me several times now even after updates when I was almost finished with parts to my stories, I lost over 2800 worth of words in my work"
273,Read more
274,so good
275,Pls let me download
276,"I love writing on this application, but can you please make the private feature returned? Cause there's no that features, my story got plagiarism by other and turn out lots of another users's stories got plagiarism. Also please make a feature that our story what we've been published couldn't copied when ppl read it on browser or other action to minimize the plagiarize act. Also can you add font style for the story, sometimes it really boring with that font. Thank you"

283,"This app is good and I have it for years, but the only problem I have is when I go to my library, it takes forever to load. Can someone tell me how to fix it because I already tried deleting some story's in my library and it still load so slow."
284,it's so amazing
285,I've been hearing that you can earn coins by watching videos therefore i can not see such option in this app . All i know is you can only read your desired book only after getting a premium
286,"Let me tell you.. This wouldve gotten five stars if it wasn't for this new update.. I've been using wattpad for a long time now it was perfectly fine until this update came and I'm not going to lie I love the liking comment update but now there's literally an ad after every 2,3 or 4 chapters It's irritating. And you can't even add offline stories to your offline list like that again. Please if this could be fixed I'd love that."
287,Great app but the erased all my data and I had to restart everything
288,Why i can't download it even if the network is fine üòï

359,3 star only cause I don't know what happen this past few days. When I search stories it's always says your search did not match any stories I dunno what happen it was not like this in any other day.

361,It's amazing the only issue is that I choosed dark mode and when reading it still light can you please fix this
362,Usually a great app but lately whenever I've tried to search a specific tag or book name nothing comes up I've had to delete it twice and re download it only for it to go back to not working

366,"I've been reading in wattpad for months now, and when I opened it earlier and I searched for a story I've been searching for months like yesterday the search bar works good and the stories I see it but now every time I search the story I searched for months it doesn't show even if it's other stories"
367,Doesn't matter how I search for a story it will just give me random stories that don't go with what I was searching up no matter how I do it after I updated it now I have a hard time finding the things that I search for it will give me very vague options ever since I updated it now if I don't hit title and then typing what I was searching for it will say that it is not found and it didn't do this before I updated it. Like I said before sometimes it won't even give me any stories I looked for
368,It is really good I've been reading a lot of amazing storys from other fantastic creators. But there's just one problem when I want to search a story it just said 'Your search did not match any stories' like what? Am just so confused but pls fix this:(
369,"The app is good but from few days it is not working in my system like I really don't know how it's happening, like there is glitch in its processor"
370,Best app ever
371,How to read free without signing in Google or Facebook? Because I made a new one and I keep making the password which doesn't work with anything I write and it won't even tell me what the requirements areeeüò≠

375,I'm a writer
376,"I heard lots of writers lost interest writing in this platform because their stories was copied by someone and posted it in a website. Even her username was there. I'm one of those writers, and I don't think I'll continue it with you. Cause it's really a horrible feeling when you saw your stories being copied without your consent. I don't know though, if those thieves was typing the words one by one. But the only thing I can say is; I hope, you'll gonna make your security tight."
377,"I like this app, but I have one quite major gripe for drafting. I was drafting a book with a 158 chapters, and once I went to edit that chapter, or any other chapter in said book, it cuts to a gray screen and kicks me out of the drafted book. I think maybe because of limits, it kicks me out, but the max chapters allowed to draft is (I think) 200, so why is it 158 for me?
