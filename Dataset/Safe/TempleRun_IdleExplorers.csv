"Edit: Fun time waster, I like that the VIP is a QOL feature, and the game is fine without needing to pay. The game pace gets painfully slow around expedition 16 to the point it feels pay to play, they really need to increase the amount of scrolls you can collect. The events are a fun way to make things feel a bit more fast-paced while also showing the capabilities of leveling up the runners. The gear that was supposed to unlock at 16 never unlocked either. The game needs a lot of tweaking."
Fun and addictive
I don't like this game. Please make an endless runner game like temple run 2 again or just update temple run 2 because i love it. This game gets boring easily and it's hard to continue playing it.
Opopopop Game
Good
"Sorry i don't like this Game, but you Temple Run Developer Team so 4 star 🙂"
Totally waste
Good!
This is bad I am sorry but can you make temple run 3 the game was a bad game I didn't know about why you made this
Harsh
💗💗
Very nice temple run IDLE
"Another generic idle game that abuses a nostalgic IP Dev response: I don't know if this is an automated response, but you seem to think that I care about the change(?) This is just a generic idle game that uses the original game's IP to earn easy money instead of making an original idea."
I think I know how this idle game works now. Love the graphics and I have fun playing.
When I was 6 years old I like to play temple run
"Not bad, just needs adjustments to the story"
"I can't craft artifact in tutorial, taping on ""Craft"" doesn't work"
This is very very bad game 🤮
This game is too bad 😔
"Sorry Imangi, but this game does not have soul. It's just not interesting. I'm deleting it."
This game always hangs when claiming things
"When I closed the game and reopened it, all of my progress was gone"
This game is not good

"No doubt the game is good, but I'm at level 9 & i stucked at one mission , win 9 challenge stars in this expedition and i get 7 of them but I don't have more run challenges to get 2 stars I don't know what to do"
Nice game It's interesting You don't get bored
कुछ समझ में नहीं आया यह क्या है। Pls explained what is in this game।
The best game ever
Bad

Bad game
good games
It's full of bug please re create it
Good game but need more to be developed..
"I like the idea of it, but can't even get through the tutorial. The game keeps freezing."
Add gplay achievements
Visually stunning for a mobile game! The concept of exploring the world of temple run is super interesting and imaginative! Fantastic!
it's a amazing experience
Lame
Good
Kind of not making us to do anything with brain. Too much in under 30 mins but can't move forward without diamonds and it should be provided atleast hardway to earn them but kept as paywall. Overall Ok for now..
Not good
Very Bad Game...PLZ DONT PLAY THIS GAME.....TEMPLE RUN 1 IS BETTER THAN THIS...THANKS
Worst game
One of the best Idle type games I have ever played. Temppe run was my childhood game and now playing it in this new style is amazing and fun. Thanks Imangi studios for giving us this amazing game.
THIS IS NOT A TEMPLE RUN. THIS IS SO DISGUSTING GAME COLLECT COINS AND RUN..
Gis
I wanted to give one star but you're getting two because of your past Release Temple run 2. Not gonna lie first impressions were great until I realized I need the internet to play it
Don't li6
Bad experience
Good
"Well those reviews are fake , it's all a plan to down temple run idle I guess. Maybe it's a devious plan of Subway surfers idk, I haven't found any error in this game it's very addictive timekiller my words are small to describe.. i advice you to must install this you'll thank me forever 💓. And lastly sorry for my bad English. Tata👋"
"Is very fun so far :) I'm enjoying the humor and the plot, and the gameplay is very intuitive and enjoyable too"
"Not working properly, stuck on a single screen and cannot click any option. There is some glitch."
I'm first dawnload this game
Nice game but improve ❤
I expected that in this game we will run with some quest and have a story but it's story is bad and gameplay is even worst . I can simply say I expected too much from this one. I gave it 2 stars only because I was somehow intrested in this story I don't know why.
"Not properly open in my phone. Why i wasted my time and internet, the reason is temple run oz."
"I understand it's yet to be patched, however I have noticed a couple of issues while playing: 1. 2/3 times the game claims I'm not connected to the internet all the while having a strong and stable internet connection AND unlimited data as a backup 2. The game often claims my Play account isn't synced with the game despite it always being connected 3. Loading times need improvement. On the average it takes the game 3-4 minutes to load on my device 4. The game often crashes, especially after ads"
I am unable to understand the game. what is the main goal can you tell me . What type of game is this . I am going to uninstall. I will reinstall in 1 week if you make this app better I will keep it....
I am running and I am complete runing but gate is not come route generate same route and repeate it
Op brother 😊😊😊 Best game
Waste of time
The game literally doesn't let me claim the rewards from the first chest. I click on it and then the game doesn't even let me click the X or anything else so I'm basically stuck
This game is very slow download
It is so good I love it I love it it is so good 👍 😍
I can't log in ☹️
I am not able to claim the coins collected and move forward.
The normal one was far better
Game can't play
"This app is a total waste of data, its nothing like temple run at al, well i won't advice anyone to download it😒"
Good ❤️‍🔥
App can't open.
Excellent
Fun game
"The game just doesn't go past the ""claim 10 coins"" option during launch."
Terrible.. nothing to do in the game except clicking on the index finger😬
Very bad 😞😞
Very bad game
A new spin on Tample.Run and a.lot of fun.
So fantastic
Complete waste of time.
I like the game it's different from other idle games my only issue I have is that I Pre Registered the game and I never received my Character card or the Character Dante when u Pre Registered but I can't wait to see the future in this game in Future updates.
Lean. more My Tom
Worst ever
"Super but it is different from other temple run , everyone who like temple run will play this,and the game is about an ancient things like temple run 1"
"I would give it a 5 stars but there is a kinda disturbing bug When you get the 2 pieces, it tells u to click on ""craft artifact"" when I click it the game suddenly dosent let me do anything like I cannot click anything on the screen I hope if you guys can help me with that problem<33"
It's disappointing that such a good game has no Google Play achievements in it.
"I can't change the assign the runner to a different site even after clicking that option. Your app, temple run, whenever I reinstall, starts from beginning, even after Google Play login. App not available on PC. Imagine studios, if want, can make temple run highly advanced using unreal Engine 5.1"
One of the best idle games I've played! Lots of opportunities to get bonuses from watching ads. I can just leave the game open and tap the ads every once in a while to get a bunch of bonuses. Highly recommend for idle game fans.
"Very disappointed from the app,total time waste app"
New game is best but next game is temple run 3!
I can't run.but I love this game.
A quick easy idle game with a good story and characters
Nice game but cartoon type 🙂
Most boring game of all the time
As a old temple run fan I see a lot of potential on this game
Best game of all. it is the best game than TR and TR 2 . I love this too much 💕😘. Best 🎮 😎
AWESOME 😎😎
Download the game now only I am downloading
The ultimate jungle run is going to be the biggest yet. Only one will be crowned the king of the jungle. Are you up to the challenge?
Hey when I started this game when you collect the gems it'll just softlock the whole game in the tutorial and I really want to see the rest of the game. Please fix this
Today the game launch.. .Suddenly iam install too...
Very good game
I liked it😌
"Havent played yet,but im damn sure this gonna be a banger of games.love u imangi made my childhood better"
Temple run 2 jada achaa tha
First download good game
Worst game it's testing ur patience and time waste game
Very good game
Not understand
Op
"I think it's my first review, but game was impressive"
"I miss old game, why you named it temple run i lost my 112mb 😭"
Good But same as temple run 2
Best game so fun
I don't understand how it is related to temple 'RUN'
Old Temple Run is very nice
This game is super ❤️👌
Nice app from Imangi studios
Thanks Imagi ♥️♥️
App is now just stuck can't do anything
Good
I didn't get to play it because it says you need internet connection even tho i already had a connection it still wouldn't let me play
Bad app
Didn't chack it yet just want to tell make temple run 3
This is a good game to relax the mind
"Greatly disappointed by this app, you're under the assumption when you download the app that you'd be controlling the runner like in the original temple run. But in actually it just a short sequence that you have little control over. The game babies you throughout the tutorial and gets boring quickly. A basic game with a good premise and poor execution."
I download this game did a couple of things then it just stopped working. I closed the app tried again . And same thing happened in the same spot
Few bugs that need sorting out
"Buggy. I've cancelled my sub and uninstalled. You hit a wall at level 21 which is irritating enough but the scrolls bugged out and after several days, I've given up on hearing from tech support."
"This game has potential, but on its current state, it is unplayable. You'll be stuck on farther levels because of impossible goals. Also, the game support is non-existent. Why bother putting that feature when the support team doesn't even care. Lastly, there is no cloud save so if somehow you get some bugs and glitches, there is no way of moving forward."
I love this browser🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Game is bugged and unplayable. Scroll system is bugged. Needs fixing
It's nice game
"I went in expecting a game where you get runners and watch them run, collecting coins like the original game. Instead, I found a janky AdVenture Capitalist rip-off with a run mechanic that isn't very good. I would much rather prefer something in the same vein as Nonstop Knight, where you go until you die then go again. The art style is charming, at least, but it isn't really Temple Run."
I literally only installed this because they ruined my childhood
This is OSM
Look how they massacred my boy
"Absolutely dreadful, this game has no sense of what an idle game is, heavily pushes Micro-Transactions with advertisements for ""deals"" that never leave the side of your screen and slows the game to a halt as early as level 3 so you are pressured to buy chests and gems to progress. I never leave reviews, but seeing as i used to like the Temple Run series, I thought I should leave an Honest review. There are better Idle games out there besides this one."
A very good game
No thought put into this game. Where is the fun?
"Good game, but the fact that there was a major connection issue during an event annoyed me. Rating will change if the next event isn't interrupted."
Worst app you will find on app store
I stuked many times in game and i don't know why
"You bastards, you killed temple run!!"
❤️
Used to like but they added auto play ads
Horrible tutorial of all time
"What happened? This has ruined the legacy of temple run, the old childhood game."
Niceeee
Little caesars pizza and good luck with the rest of the week and I will be there at like good news is that I have to go to the store and get some rest and feel better soon and that is the only way I can get a ride to the airport on Friday
This game is good
Good game
Good game
I love it
I like this game
You want to be a great day and
Sow many characters and coll the game the graphics it's asom
"I had a lot of fun playing, but now the game won't load. Even while wifi is on it says ""check internet connection"". Hoping it's just a bug being worked on so I can play again :L I'll change to 4 stars when it happens"
I don't know where is the running I mean like its called temple run for a REASON
Waste of time can't understand what to do Tutorial was very long
the very bad thing about this game is that it is online 🙃🙃🙃
Good
Goal to automate jail won't complete. Game bug. Can't advance.
Annoying garbage so far. Temple run? Sure. A pale attempt at a once ok game. 40 mins later and still being forced through pointless tutorials. 1 hr later now. Still getting random tutorials. Absolutely awful running mechanics. Awful graphics. And atrocious money scaling. Simpley an awful game not worth the space it takes on my phone.
I love this game but please add a cloud save
Great game.
The game was fun up until it started re setting my play every time I left the game and re entered. All the money and building for that level that I unlocked was gone
Just tap tap game and chores of making pretend money. 😴
It's a fun idle game but it's also simultaneously a gacha which makes it a bit dubious. I don't mind that part but my main issue is the game progression is extremely unbalanced and there's so many bugs I can't begin to list them all. It's a very unpolished game that should have had more time in development before being released.
"Great game, it's fun. Sure I have played similar games, but none that allow a non paying player to do well in events. I fully finished my first event, but I also watched lots of ads. As I prefer this to having to pay. So at least the devs are getting something out of it too."
"I'm very disappointed with this game, it's been online loading for 1 hour"
Stupid game says wfi won't work
Good game
"This kind of ruins the temple run name, and it's a bad idle game"
👎🙅✖️❎❌🚫🚳🚭🚯🚱🚷📵🔞🔕🔇
"Please add an reset button ,I'm stuck at the ""per second quest"" ,but overall this is a good game"
Make this offline game please 🥹🥹
"No offline progression for events apparently... also there's no point in ever running, as no matter how strong your team is, they'll damn near always get one shot"
"This game is buggy, sometimes it always stops to 98.21% please fix it"
played for a while unlocked some run challenge thing and it got stuck onto that cant press anything anymore
Cool but gets boring
"Great game at first but when you reach map 10 or 12, the quest is insanely hard like Get 10.0jj per second or collect 25kk coins..."
It's too boring because it's idle and I hate those
This game is not that bad. Maybe it feels a bit of awkward because the genre doesn't feel like coming from Temple Run publisher.😀 I am a long time player of both Temple Run.
Pls make it not glich it gets stuck on 98% like always and i saw pic on the game it looks fun pls fix ill rate it 5 if you do so
great game but it needs a save file because i reinstall the game and i cant go back to my restored file can you pls implement that
Whatis it?!!
"After one of the maps game got permanently stuck on 91.35% loading. I wrote to support and waited few weeks, got reply that game was updated and bug fixed. But there was no update available. After that support just went silent. Game is still unplayable."
OUCH!
Hello! I just want to say this is the best idle game EVER for my opinion... And I got a few suggestions for the devs 1st is I would like the run minigame to be more controllable like the older temple run. 2nd is add more characters it would be awesome too see more characters it would make the game more interesting And that's all I got too say.
"This game is buggy. It sometimes gets stuck on 91.35% loading. Then when it loads, you can't click on the rewards when you finish a task. You have to restart the app. When you do, you need to start the task again."
The boot-up loading screen stops at 91.35%. Fix yo $h1t
"There's a bug when I try to ""run"" to open a new building, it doesn't let me ""run"". No matter how manny time I pressed it, and I even relogin, I still cant progress, pls fix this😞 shame, Iam having so much fun untill this but happened"
very nice game
I like the game becose its new
imagine falling off this hard though
Cool game
So good btw im the first one to rate this game ☆☆☆☆☆
this game is very good
