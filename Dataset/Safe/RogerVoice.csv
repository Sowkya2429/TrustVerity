Just not good
Works great! ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°
Brilliant app. I have hearing loss and clarity on the phone is an issue. This app makes phone calls possible again. Love it!
This app is brilliant. I am profoundly deaf and had to ask other people to make my telephone calls. The transcription is really quick. I was actually quite emotional the first time I used it as it made me feel normal and like a hearing person. It's given me independence. The only reason that I've given 4 stars is that several times I've been cut off in the middle of a call. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
Very good app
"I really really want to give this app a 5 star rating. I'm deaf but don't like video relay which deaf people use to make their calls. I would really really love to be able to use this app for all my phone needs. The voice transliteration seems amazingly accurate. But it doesn't seem to work for incoming calls. Only outgoing calls work well. To the Rogersvoice team, please somehow make it possible for incoming calls to work in this app. Then Rogersvoice would be a total game changer for me!"
Awesome Awesome AWESOME! I Love It! ‚ù§Ô∏è
The app is not transcribing the words I am speaking on the phone of the person I am calling
Tricky
This app is awesome. I have a hearing handicap and could not engage in phone conversations until I got this. The transcribing is realtime with no waiting or delays. Best if you speak clearly and slower if technican. A life saver ...
"A little hard to navigate during a call, but the transcription is very good. Support is good."
Amazing transcription. Permanent profanity filter. Won't do full screen notifications on Android.
So helpful for those with hearing losses!!!
This is a really clever bit of tech. I've just spoken to my 90 yr old father who is very hard of hearing. He is still getting used to it but we have had a decent phone conversation for the first time in years
"it is saying I have amessage but its stuck, it is not opening up for me to see the message!"
Re Really help full
"For Australian users: While this app is a good concept, there is no way to use the app for incoming calls. Wasted $10 on a subscription before I realised this. You can still make outgoing calls as an Australian user."
"I've only just downloaded this, but so far great app. Wonderful customer support."
Allows 89 year old mother to have phone conversations again - awesome!
Excellent! Works very we'll! It has given me ohine calls back. Can't thank the developers enough!
Based on the 1 call I made during setup. WAY TOO MUCH echo & other background noise to pick up voices clearly so very little was interpreted. I'm sure part of the problem was that I was calling a landline from my cell phone in the same room. Otherwise it's a 4-5 * app!
"For phone conversations excellent!! Have a query! I should be able to have Voicemail automatically transcribed, cannot achieve this!"
"I was struck totally deaf by covid a year ago. Found Roger and was saved from being isolated from my family. He has a few hiccups from time to time but is most consistent app of this kind I've found. Thanks for this app, it's been a lifesaver for me. Janelle in Montana"
Good app
App doesn't allow resigstrston. I tried 3 different phone numbers. None works
There are glitches. Customer service not always available
Captions freeze during a lengthy phone call. Need to restart phone and app before returning the call.
My mum lost her hearing about two years ago and I never realised how much I missed talking to her on the phone until I got this app. Its got a better transcribing feature than the vast majority of transcribe specific apps and is incredibly easy to use. Can't rate it highly enough.
"I've had ups and downs with this app. my unlimited plan was randomly cancelled - I didn't request this. It is similar to live captions on Teams, a slight delay & it cannot understand names of people or places. Luckily I can connect my hearing aid to my phone and catch some speech, as I couldn't rely entirely on app alone. I would like to see date & time of calls and ideally for them to show in my phone call logs also - not just the app. Customer service are responsive during working hours."
A great relief for a profoundly deaf person
Ousy. App. Drops calls won't connect many times. I don't like it at all. But it
Fantastic! I wear hearing aids because I had mumps middle childhood. I cannot hear ordinary speech on a phone. I have just been able to speak to my daughter to bring something for her to a friend's house. Very good translation. Would definitely recommend this app. 5 stars
"Clear,and only the odd mistake eg misses came as Mrs"
This banana app needs your phone number
I love it. I am very hard of hearing and it's so nice to be able to know what the other party is saying.
"The answer button does not work on the pop up when using the phone, only when you go into the app and the it answers fine. Would like to add only specific contacts rather than letting app have access to all contacts."
"Since I am deaf, Roger voice knocks down a huge communication block."
"It's fun learning to use it, very good. Love the larger text easy to read quickly. I would rate it four and half stars."
$30 a month is ridiculous. Everything they are using us free software. $30 a month I could buy a real hard of hearing device for phone calls. This app doesn't even allow you to modulate the coming voice. Just a cash grab. They try to tell you app to app calls are free but that is useless for 90% of calls.
Good quality voice to text translation. Just need clear stepwise instructions on carrying operations like using the speaker phone.
The idea and objetivo behind this app is great however there is much work to do with the transcripts specially in other laguanges.
I called my sister in law and had a great visit with her and her husband...this was my first-time call when I am alone.
Don't pay for this I have canceled it and still get charged I connect them and they say say connect Google store and still charged f this app if they can't manage their own app should not have it it is not worth it I give it no stars if I could
Not free like other applications.. I like the easy connection once I get used to your app! Please let me have full access to your app üôè.. I'm disabled deaf person which gets ssdi flat rate of about $800/month.... I don't have any extra money to pay for an app for only 1 hour at a time ... that's expensive üòï üòí Please reconsider my request for free access or me paying $5... monthly for unlimited calls üìû? Ty very much üòä in advance for your consideration and time for important calls!! Ty üíó
"That's sad some people believes that the developers should pay for the service instead, and they pull down the rating. The app is wonderful, thank you!"
no easy way to know how app affectsother apps
"Without Roger voice, I would not be able to make calls from my cell."
Amazing its made life much easier
Wonky
Instantan√©... Je comprends ce que je n'entendais pas par telephone! MERCI
"Works pretty well...too expensive IMO, and if you don't do app-to-app calls, your end of the conversation isn't transcribed"
why is it not availble in asian languages??
"""The country code isn't supported for call,"" way to make non Europe/American deaf feel bad. Thanks for nice app, I'm uninstalling it."
"Did not like the $29/mo unlimited calling fee, not the $5/one-hour/per month fee."
When i subscribed I got 30 minutes as credit. Isit free or charged credit?
"Super slow transcribing. A conversation is not really possible. It works, but there are free services for deaf. This app is not worth paying for time."
This has helped me communicate with my wife who is deaf.
Roger voice is not Good üò§ I would like delete now
"Gracias mil a esta app, mi madre de 80 a√±os se puede comunicar en tiempo real.Soy del norte de Per√∫ y le falta una que otra palabra coloquial, pero en un 99.9% todo bien.Dios bendiga a los desarrolladores de esta app.Thanks a lot!!!"
"I'm the hearing impaired person. I call my daughter and I can hear her but she cant hear me, worse the transcription was terrible. I said can you hear me speaking and this was transcribed to are you stupid and that was the second attempt to say the same thing. I would like to delete rodgervoice now."
"Worst Customer service EVER. My sons line has been down for 5 days now. No number to call for help and CS replies with a question once every 24 hours and only answers messages in the middle of the night. Answer is ""please be patient"". Meanwhile he cannot receive any calls on his phone and no one can even leave a voice-mail because the message they get is that the phone number has been disconnected."
Exceptional
"You can't use it without a code, and they wouldn't send me one for DAYS. Now, they're texting me one every two minutes, after I gave up and deleted the app last week!"
To expensive... !!!!!!!!
Great app. Gets a 3-star score for not supporting emergency numbers. I can't honestly believe the developers want deaf people to screw off in an emergency? That's ridiculous!
Aife saver if you have trouble hearing
It has absolutely changed my life. I am deaf but now I can hear through the transcription! It is a true miracle that allows me to communicate once again on my phone! Thank you Rogervoice!
Good translation and preferable to things like Google Live Caption which auto announce to people you're using a voice calling service
Doesnt work properly. I got too annoyed.
"Excellent app , I am using it."
Awesome
A promising piece of IT . It could save a lot if frustration for deaf people.
The app only works when both users have the app installed. It was excellent. Did not work if the other user did not have the app.
Excellent. Very helpful. But do get occasional people who hang up thinking I'm winding them up. Be good if there was a preset optional pre-recorded message to inform them a deaf person is calling and to have some patience. Thank you.
So much better
Easy communication but limit only 1 hour a month
"C'est vraiment pourri, il y a tellement d'attente pour la personne qu'on appelle qu'elle se demande s'il y a m√™me qqn l√†. En plus le message au d√©but qui dit que c'est un appel d'une appli est tellement courte et vient apr√®s bcp de silence donc je crois que la plupart des gens raccrocheraient !! Vraiment d√©√ßue. C'est pas du tout utile."
A life saver!!!!
Very weird talk back from someone texting but it worked.
Doesn't work with speaker phone mode.
I have only used it once transcrip was very good but i could not hang up.I wish I could put on speaker phone(very hard of hearing but not deaf it would help)
Haven't been able to use a phone for years due to deafness. This app enables me to speak to my family. It's liberating.
This app has been a miracle as it has been difficult to use the local provider. The only thing I'm not clear about is how to select options if I'm calling an organization that answers with a voicemail and I need to choose an option. I'm not sure how to do that. Currently I just wait until I get through to someone. Otherwise this is great.
"Pas mal. Il faut par contre demander au correspondant de bien articuler sinon le logiciel de transcription est largu√©. Je n'ai fait qu'un appel et mon correspondant se plaint d'une qualit√© de son ex√©crable ( gr√©sillement) alors que je l'entends parfaitement bien ( peut-√™tre √† cause de ma connexion internet qui n'est pas terrible) . Les d√©veloppeurs font malgr√© tout un bon travail, je vous encourage √† am√©liorer davantage cette app üôÉ"
Well i pay this servie $30 a month now i cant call out or recvie call
Wonderful
I'm from Australia and I can't called to a company about my bills because Roger Voice won't accepted.
Works good but should be free!
Thank you for support
Has been very helpful.
Easy
You have to pay for your call plans
Managed to have a phone conversation with my sister for the first time in years. It was very simple and really quite wonderful. She's struggled with hearing loss for decades and she's a big fan of Rogervoice
I love this app because I am hearing impaired and I can talk with my daughter long distance
"Great app, just I wish the developer can add option when I talk to not display as chat about what I am saying because I am deaf and I can't speak my voice properly."
Need to get to know it
Cant find a way to cancel subscription as it was charging me without me knowing
Just used this for an interview chat and was fantastic
"Does what it says, but it's listed as free which it is not ... it's a 15 minute trial!"
"So far so good. Not perfect, but I live in the sticks. Internet provides better transcription. I hope it will improve with practice."
Roger voice is a good service for oral deaf
Very over priced
"I tried the app using introductory free credit to try out and it was great. I managed to make two calls using the free credit. Pleased with the app, I've decided to continue with the app and paid for a plan five days ago however I have not received any credits thus cannot make any calls. Reaching out to support a few times was met with total silence. It's a shame that a seemly good app didn't live up to expectations. Cancelling subscription and will be uninstalling. :-( Update: Got refunded."
Voice to text poor
I already downloaded app but I didn't receive a CODE message from rogervoice. I have tried many times but still didn't receive the code message. Please advise. Thanks
Works great!
Just trying it out so far wonderful . I have ALS & am totally non-verbal except for gruntsüòè. This was s best so far. I try to work subscription for unlimited in my budget. I on $982.00/month income from social security disability. Thanks for making app!!!‚úåÔ∏è
"Party did not answer, but RV texted/ captioned the recorded message pretty fully and accurately, not perfect, but good enough. I'll have to try again when party is home."
How can I translating the voice when they call me on my cellphone ? Only this app is for this person who wants call for people Regards
I installed Rogervoice and tried it several times. It simply did not work anywhere close to satisfactorily. Signing up is easy. Canceling is damn near impossible. It took 3 days for their website messaging people to get back to me. Billing is extremely obscure and goes from PayPal to Google to Freedom to Rogervoice. It is very important for you to understand that you cannot cancel the service via the Rogervoice website. Let the buyer beware!!!
Not able to receive calls even after enabling call forwarding. Making calls works well but receiving calls has issues after enabling call forwarding
Very nice. Using it for hearing impaired.
Woke up deaf one morning zero hearing daughter found this app able to communicate with family some now thanks roger
It's not free
"It might work great, never been able to try it. It says you get some free time but right after downloading it says trial time is used up. So 3 stars to give them benefit of the doubt."
"Great application, a must for peaple with hearing problems"
I receive code after 10 min and then it's never accepted üò†üò†
"When the phone is doing it's, thing while you're on this app, talking to someone it cuts you off or just stop working whether the phone doing it thing or not. I deleted the app and found a better one."
Did a horrible job transcribing what the person said
Doesn't work and ridiculously expensive do not download
"Voice recognition isn't always great, but if one party can hear ok, it's actually still pretty good. Definitely faster than typing and I still get to hear the other person talk. Great service and I hope you keep it going. Definitely improves communication experience for deaf."
Wife and I are both hearing impaired. First call went smoothly and really picked up the words pretty good.
"Hard to navigate and disconnect. App, modulates with out any directory, direction.... I didn't know what was going on."
Does not work
"The app is perfect but the plans aren't exactly cheap, would be good if it can connect to a normal call trought accessibility services"
"Great App, has really enabled me to function like others who use a phone and not just for email or texting either"
The transcript was poor. The person on the other end either count l couldn't hear me or told me I sounded like a robot
I couldn't be happier. I am almost in tears since I am able to make a normal phone call now for the first time in forty years.
It suck it my call won't got through rogers and the is same as my phone number so how can phone transfer my call to rogers so that I can know what the other person is saying to me
Second review called HM tax and it was 90% accurate. Wow thank you.
please make it avaliable in Bangladesh
As a deaf person I would be lost without this app app it's 95% effective of course sometimes people don't speak very well or mumble that's not the apps fault I am very happy and doesn't cost the Earth
You get about 15 to 20 minutes of phone calls where it will transcribe the callers voice pretty well. Not sure about subscribing if it works well enough to purchase that.
"Really Great idea but needs improvement! It actually works quite well for the duration of the call, I use German and English, only problem is the transcript gets automatically deleted after ending the call which makes it somewhat pointless. Bit pricey :-("
I had a handset phone with captions which is not going to be available. So I needed something to replace it for my mobile. Rogervoice is better! Thank you so much
"I am not sure why when people try to call me on the Rogervoice-provided number, they always get a busy signal. I am not even on the phone. As a result, I am not able to receive any call from others. Why is this so?"
Horribley slow. Cant have a conversation
Here is the big issue. Taking advantage of people who are already going through difficulties and don't make a lot of money. Hard of hearing people like me should not have to pay to read captions. Plain and simple. This app seems easy to use but costs too much for calls from people who don't have the app. Very sad. Moving on.
Right now it only works when calling out . It does not open when receiving a call. I can not hear on the phone that is why I installed this. I have gone into settings and gave all the permissions. I f I can get incoming to work. I will probably raise the rating.
"This is a life saver for me, I have very poor hearing and shy from using telephones"
I had expected to have a lengthy set up but after I downloaded the app it was only a key strokes to make my first call and it transcribed very clearly.
This is the worst closed captioned system drops calls cant connect. I'll be looking for another provider.
Impossible to change the credit card you use to make payments!!!
Fabuloud
"Why does the app work at the store but as soon as I get home it craps out. Am deaf and cripple, I depend on the soft ware to hear. Please do something to help.."
It works wonderful I went and paid a subscription for this app that way I can still communicate without all my contacts do to the fact that I lost my hearing completely thank you very good good work with this app
Could be better
You buy credits then they take them of you .you try to message them 2 days to reply .trying to unsubscribe nightmare
it sucks because of the price it cost it should be a feature that is with all phones .. why should I have to pay more because I am deaf ?? In response to app to app usage being free thats great for freinds and family .. i dont need it cause they text. With me ... i used this app for professional calls to businesses with landlines ... not cell phones
It works great and is a big help to my deaf mom.
The app is great is awesome but I only give 4 because it would be great if they let us know if we are speaking with a female or a male it would be be great healp.
As I don't need the typed message it is great to hear the voice of my contact.
I'm deaf and I depend on it.
It has been very helpful for when I call someone. I just need something for when people call me .
"Although I sometimes have trouble initializing the app. once it is up and running it generally works great. I did occasionally have sessions with no transcriptions but those are getting better. That being said, it is essentially the only way I can communicate with my 93 year old Dad and for that I am very grateful and why it earns 5 stars!"
I can hear him and also see everything he is saying at the same time just like if he was right in front of me.just wonderful.
"Expensive. Useless for calling businesses on occasion, unless one is happy paying three hundred a year. Royal rip off. In the US, phone systems for the deaf are subsidized by the federal government. In spite of the name, Rogervoice is a French system. I use InnoCaption which I can utilize to call anyone free of charge. I can even place a 911 call if I ever need to do that. An amazing thing since there are many thousands of different 911s across the US. InnoCaption has that problem resolved."
"Great app! My Dad is hard of hearing and it was frustrating not being able to understand what his children were saying. He was very grateful to me for setting it up for him, and I am grateful for the makers of the app improving his quality of life! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
I am deaf this is a heaven sand the transcription comes through very clearly on a few calls that I've tried however the people that I have called said that my voice comes through very staticy of course that may be due to my location I'll report back and read it again after I try this some more but so far I'm very happy with the app
Gave 2 stars as it was getting good until the app close on me.  Just installed this app today to test and it was working for couple minutes calling to a regular office number so I can make an appointment then the app closed on me saying thanks for using it.  I checked that I have 58 minutes of credit.  Why did the app close on me when I still have 58 minutes left?
"No app has given me this type of excellent performance. I do hope it will continue like this. To me, Rogervoice is flawless."
unavailable to Nigeria
This app is easy to use and helps me understand people I can't clearly hear. I also use it with deaf friends and grandparents that have difficulty hearing. Please spread the word!
This app is the difference between being lost and being able to have normal conversations.
I'm deaf. Why should we have to pay a monthly subscription to even use it When we need to use it to make out going calls to make appointments? I rely on this kind of app to make appointments!!! Let alone we deaf people have to pay our own regular monthly cell phone bill and Roger voice wants more money to use their app. That's expensive! So no thanks!! I'm installing!!
great apps
Brilliant app and work outstandingly well.
im so happy this app was invented ive been struggling to talk to my mom since shes hard of hearing and cant understand me through the phone with this app its a life saver so grateful for it thank you i set the language to be in spanish and there some words that it was confused about but still works really good
"Fast transcriptions, very little network lag time, and reasonably accurate considering individual differences in speech clarity and speed."
so useful!! tanka mucho ü§ì
the best of this type of app..love it
Why this app is not working for India
"As a mute, I loved being able to make calls. The problem lies in the fact that I wasn't issued a phone number. Then, it took their customer service 2 days to respond to my initial query followed by an additional 6 days to actually address the issue. That is 8 days of not having the entire service. When they finally got back to me, the phone number did not work. It was not connected. In what way is an 8 day wait for basic customer service acceptable? The transcription was pretty good."
does not work.
Good app. My mother suffers from hearing loss and this app has been very helpful. Thank you Rogervoice
"should be free.. I need this to use the phone, how can I call anyone ?"
"Totally changed my life, gave me the additional independence that I never had before! This is not a perfect app as there has been some growing pains as they work out the kinks. Their customer service has been outstanding as they've worked hard to resolve any issues I've had."
This app requires a difficult registration and I am sure it exists cheaper App in the Playstore.
"Based in France - Customer Service hours is opposite that in North America. Any requests will not be dealt with until the next day. Extremely difficult to have a dialog with them as responses will come 24hrs later. Despite paying for several subscriptions, it never showed up in my app and they have not been able to fix it - I give up!  Ideal for European use only."
"This is an extremely useful app to allow deaf or hear-impaired people to call to any kind of phone (or receive free calls from RogerVoice users) and then speaking normally and reading the live transcription of what the other person is saying!  However, for elders it would be great to be able to DEACTIVATE in the SETUP the transcriptions for the OWN VOICE, because this only complicates and discourages using the app, without a clear advantage in most typical cases of use."
Thank You & keep up the good work
Great app but very poor customer services. They take a long time to reply to a chat and don't even fix the issue. I got a RogerVoice number but calls to my number were not connecting and despite the numerous chat messages I left they didn't reply or resolve the issue so I'm uninstalling.
"I have been trying to find this kind of app since Ive lost my hearing , always had to find someone to make phone calls for me now I can call by myself"
"Really nice app, you'll only need to speak clear and slow. English version worked perfectly but French not so much"
"When I try to call, it shows me ""unexpected error"""
I have tried to register several times yet it refused to send me the verification code. I couldn't open it...I think it can't open in Nigeria?
I wanted to send my printed text voice conversations to my email so I could store the important ones in a file folder with my other important files. Don't see that with this as app. The contact list of my contacts are located in a completely separate list specifically for using this app. It's not user friendly in that sense. The contacts should be the exact same contact list I have to my cell phone. I have it set up so my boyfriend is at the top of the list and then the list of my most frequent callers incl
"This is a good app for what its meant to do. Just speak clear and normal pace. It takes some testing to get used to .. and you need to ask others to try not speak too quick .. once you do that, its really good .. and can only improve with time and use .. I love it .."
"It's unable to call if 1hr free call to normal hearing without app. It's showing message as ""unexpected error happened"" when call to normal phone"
"Just downloaded it today and tried it out. Its quite good, the only thing 
that irks me is the fact that we have to pay a subscription. Seems like 
you're making money from people's disabilities"
"I downloaded the app and made a call to test. It works very well however 
when I looked up the pricing everything was displayed in French. I changed 
to English multiple times but kept getting French. The dollar sign was not 
American so I am unsure of the price. If it's $29 a month that's way 
outrageous"
"Doesn't recognize Chilean mobile numbers correctly. All mobiles in Chile 
begin with +569 plus an 8 digit number. This app says it's not valid."
There captioning was sport and many words did not show up. I uninstalled.
It's the most accurate far as real time and keeping up. You get some free minutes then after that you have to pay but it's so worth it
Not bad but does seem a bit steep for those that may be on a tight budget. Maybe more instructions for the different uses may help others also.
its ok but in the US there are many apps that do this for free. Innocaption is my fav.
"Well put my number in and I get a sms verification is this really your number hit ok and that it, it goes no further , great idea but it don't work"
Transcription is slow and missing some texts...
Doesn't transcribe anything
Doesn't transcribe anything
Doesn't work. I never could get it to transcribe on the receiving end. Plus freeze my phone for 60+ seconds after each call. Uninstalled.
"I couldn't even open the app. Crashed every time. I tried restarting my phone and reinstalling, no dice...."
This app kicked off with great start for those who need hearing support and rely on captions. The voice recognition is picking up in fast paced and catching most of accurate  words. It's going to get better with time especially voice recognition is going to improve anytime. Keep rocking team!
The voice recognition is unacurate. I came really close to loosing a new job I was looking for and. It's user friendly though. I am infuriated with this app and I am trying something else. Captions were unacurate and clumsey.
Call for help 4 days ago still waiting app just not working no phone receive working called for help and no luck
"Voice to text works well, but voice recognition not very good - can lead to misunderstanding. What about text to voice? Is that an option?  As this is intended for Deaf or Hard of Hearing people, why is the introduction video not subtitled?"
I cant try it due to my country is not there ....am from jamaica so i cant give review on this ... I am hard in hearing and want to find app that type what caller says live üòí
"How can I pay for extra minutes, isn't available for italian user?!"
I wish I knew about this before because I lost the ability to hear anything at all.
"Surprised at how well it worked...seamless integration with my phone, and good quality captioning of even my worst case caller."
"Does not work on ""Hang outs"" and will cost a fee per month. On phone to phone if the person spoke slowly it picked up about 90% of words.  But if they they talked at a regular speed it worked terriable"
"I call my brother once, I was surprised. It is petty like ok."
Why do we have to pay over priced fees for this service over the disability we never have control of? Please make it affordable.
Does not work at all. When it transcribes it does it wrong and at other times it doesn't transcribe at all. I subscribed and paid ¬£7.99 and wasted the money then struggled to unsubscribe. You can't do so on the mobile net site or via the app. It's a great idea for an app but the tech' just isn't in exsistence to make it work.
"So amazing to see how a nearly-deaf person was able to talk to his wife on the phone for the first time in his life. (I had installed the program on my phone in order to introduce him to the world of smart phones. He is so happy to be able to communicate in this way with his children and his friends that he is currently acquiring his first-ever smart phone, a data subscription and a credit card to pay for RogerVoice). Hurrah and Thank You to the whole team at Roger Voice for developing this great app.!!"
I like using different than speaking
I love it
Works Great.
King of the apps
They bill my card for service I don't get. I contacted someone by email and no response. This is the second month no credit applied but card has been billed!!üò†
My  name  Zachariah  Schoenheit  that  people  friendly  hearing  aids  and  deaf  people  can  make  be  used  problem
"This would be very helpful for me, but sadly I cant afford it üòî"
"This app works for me when i switched to sprint and i wasnt aware the simultanious voice and data wasnt available on newer smart phones i always used Hamilton Captel and couldnt use it anymore because it needed data and when making  calls it wont work, only on wifi....anyways Rogervoice does work even my phones own data and i can search the web and tether my phone to tablet at same time   now a big downfall i cant receive call through the app and read what someone is saying hope they can fix this"
"Pls fix it. If it's fixed, i will give 5 stars!!!"
"Why can't I sign up?  It not work when I put email in.  When I press Continue, it said certificate: null.  And other words I not understand."
Don't support persian language:-( please add persian lang. for persian deaf.
I will try it on my phone.... I have email not work and won't open
"Yes, there's a slight delay, and it's not always perfect, but overall it works! I'm so excited! It allows you to try it out without giving credit card information, and only costs $11 US per month after a trial period. Sign up was very easy. it imports your whole contact list and is very easy to use. Thank you!"
Transcript is delayed a bit and would love to have the ability to accept incoming calls using this app. Besides those two things it is an excellent app. Accuracy is about 98% but I'm not sure if that's due to my phone's software or if this app controls that.

Great app! The best app for the deaf and hard of hearing!
"Some early bugs still need to be worked out, but an app like this is long overdue."
