0,I loved the game until I found this evil pedophile pride support sorry we are out
1,Just uninstalled this game. I will not celebrate someone's sexuality I do not support Pride Month üñïüèø
2,This game is encourage my creativity
3,This is my favorite game. I have been playing for years and spent A LOT of money. My fb has been hacked. Now I can't even get in my game to play because the log in is fb. üò≠üò≠
4,"This app sucks, if you're reading this, im telling you read the first 3 words again and again."
5,"When I first started playing this game it was ranked at 4.7, it is now below 4. You thank everyone for their feedback, yet nothing has changed in the past 3 seasons. You still lose your rank if you don't make the 40 wins by month end. And if you pass into the next level, you lose all of the wins too. People want to see change. Maybe focus on that rather than $$ and you may just gain more players and a higher ranking"
6,Cool
7,Dumb game
8,I enjoy the game very much. I like seeing the different perspectives of how others see the rooms. I do like the variety of the different ideas to use and checking the outcomes.üòÄ
9,"Absolutely love this game! No adds,can play for hours!"
10,I completed the requirements for cash rewards and the rewards were not granted as promised. Earning points for cash payouts is painfully slow. The game is extremely frustrating. Had to pay money to meet goals. I do not recommend..uninstalling .
11,Cancelled Like to pick my own decorations.
12,Getting expensive.
13,"Challenging and exciting app. I get to pick which fabric colors, and ECT I want. It's like getting each spot ready to move right in. Design area's like you would want each inside an outside, paint room's,furniture and patio's. If you don't like what you picked go back look at it and change it to your preference. It's live feed and people vote on it. So you're going to know if thisis what you want. This app is up there with my 5 favorite apps. Join me in some fun and see if you got the touch."
14,"I've been playing this game for a few months now and it was something to pass the time. I have made several purchases at my own will, TODAY MY CARD WAS RAN, NOT BY MY DOING!! REDECOR-HOME DESIGN STOLE $12.84 FROM MY DEBIT CARD, THIS GAME IS SCAM....TOTALLY ROYALLY PISSED OFF!"
15,"When I see not so appealing items to design with for less money and see the more appealing items for more, I see very well that they could make it less expensive for those of is who enjoy the game and not the prices"
16,Fun design game
17,I never had such an enlightening experience because I never knew I could design anything. I am so so happy that I found this app I just can't put it down.
18,"The new formatting tool display is clunky, it takes up too much of the screen and causes the designs to be difficult to see. It would be better as an option to display the tools instead of being locked on the display."
19,"Word of advice: Stay away from this game! The developers are money hungry, corrupt thieves and they rig everything about this game. Yes, they actually steal from people. So no, you shouldn't play this game if you want to keep your money. Play Design Home. You'll thank me later."
20,"I think this game is rigged. This is obvious when three or four designs at the same time are given the exact same rating. Also, the shopping screen has suddenly moved to the shopping section when I've clicked on the free coins at the bottom. It has suddenly moved back up to the payment and starts to process an unauthorized payment! This is some shady nonsense!"
21,Perfect
22,It's great! Super fun. Although the season pass is so OP
23,I love decorating but my sites gets stolen
24,THE SHRIMPS COMMIT-WAS WALKING BY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SPOTTED A GANG OF SHRIMPS TERRORISING THE VILLIAGE. FIRE E.V.E.R.Y.W.H.E.R.E. THOSE STUPID LITTLE SODDING ARSONISTS KILLED NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES. R.I.P SHRIMP GANG üíÄüëãüç§
25,Way too many in game ads to waste money. I opened the app and got bombarded with pop ups demanding I spend money. Then I clear those and do one thing and suddenly 7 pop ups in a row about spending money for in game currency. And when I went to close the app even more started popping up
26,"I loved it at first. You have to spend a lot to turn out competitive designs. More & more items are introduced & you need coins to obtain them. They cost $$. In addition, most of the time players don't follow what the challenge states. More often than not if you don't do a completely neutral design, you won't rate well. I love color, so overall, this game is not for me."
27,I love to design rooms it's relaxing. I do think üí¨ that more items sould be unlocked easier.
28,I loved this game up until the revamp and Playtika took control. Cost of items went from hundreds to thousands. They also put a cap on getting coins so unless you pay real money you are only able to enter 1 or 2 challenges. Now while I am playing I get booted out of the game and when I get back in the challenge is all black and I am unable to play. I reached out to the help desk and all it says is that is that they are sorry and do not delete app or I will lose all I have accomplished.
29,"I totally love this app. But If you are a competitive person, it will make you angry. That's why I gave it four stars. I just enjoy designing."
30,Once a great game ruined . Everything is super expensive and need to buy new items avery chalange. The reting is wrong
31,"This I have been waiting for: top notch challenge with masterpiece art collection vs. preselected materials. Redecor choice - maps of the world. What a farce! Bad enough each masterpiece costs 1500 tokens. Redecor must guarantee success by limiting design competition to most lackluster category, maps. Challenge style, Victorian era. Ridiculous. Been playing for a couple years, skipped farmhouse. Now it's tropical holiday with Kai. Redecor, rethink your game strategy. For me the party is over."
32,It's a fun app
33,"Creative, amazing ü•∞))"
34,I just bought a pack when I joined through Google. Then I signed in through Facebook and lost all my coins and bought items! What?! I'm getting rid of the game. Not worth the aggravation. Sucks too. Because I liked the game.
35,A very habitual an creative App to express your colorful side of art furniture design!
36,i just submitted 2 designes befor the 26 minuers ran out i steped away from my cromebook to attend to my grandchild when i cameback my computer the games was no longer there has to restat my crome book and the 2 designs i submitted wre gone whats the deal i submitted them befor time ran out and you take them away from me what kinda games does that iv been playing a long time fix thius problem or give me my points i deserve or i will unenstall and revews travel quickley by word of mouth this is
37,"I used to LOVE this app until recently EVERY TIME I tried to press a design it say trouble loading, try again later. And I had thought oh, it's because I'm in the car but I had thought it was weird because some of my other apps were working but NO, the next day, NOT in the car, AT HOME, it still says the same thing! I tried deleting it and reinstalling it but that didn't work enless it has something to do with MY account. And that was my calming comfort game so it's a real disappointment. üò°"
38,Who does the voting? 5 year olds? Seriously...My design looks brilliant compared to a design with random colours that don't even match and then I score lower. I am done with this game.
39,I love this game I think it very interesting at times. Sometime it hard to make a 3 but it challenging for me. Love it
40,Awesome game üéÆ
41,I really love this game the 1 thing that I don't like is the required items for each challenge is hardly ever available to buy so it's like they force u to buy diamonds because to items u need is locked they constantly ask u to buy something it's beginning to be a little aggravating with all the pop up screens everyone that plays this game is not rich...ghee!!!!
42,Problem to login
43,Love this game. Fun & relaxing ‚ù§
44,"Honest Review: At first, it is super fun! But you learn very quickly that you don't have access to near the materials needed to win these challenges. You either have to PAY $ for the better design stuff or you're going to be stuck with hardly anything worthwhile to design with, causing you to lose challenges to ppl who pay. Then you're out of coins to keep playing. Seems like everything centers around making $$$. But no disturbing ads so that's a +."
45,It's very good and interesting
46,This seemed good but I can't play it because my child download the game and put her age in which was to young. So please add a way to redo age please.
47,What can I say awesome game. Just love it
48,"I played Redecor tiredlessly until they basically redesigned the game. Yesterday, I downloaded it again and noticed it's completely different and not in a good way. Challenged don't reward enough and the materials are way too expensive. They basically force people to buy new materials in order to spend more coins. Before, I didn't feel like I was being ripped off and gladly payed for the season pass. Now, that's not the case."
49,This game is so relaxing üòé
50,What A Blast..and No Crazy Commercialz..Able to See otherz Designz..and Vote..
51,I love this app. Not only is it fun designing rooms and people want to know your kind of style there is competition to go along with it. I like it.
52,I enjoy playing this game. But it doesn't really give much new furniture for money I put on a card .
53,This is an amazing game and I would spend all day playing this if I could
54,Very nice
55,"I have played this game every day for at least 3 years. It used to be fun and relaxing. Now they put up 5 or 6 popups asking you to spend money on this or that, or that, or this or this. I have spent money on the game in past, but it's increasingly hard to play without spending money. I could tolerate that, but the ads are crazy, constantly interrupting you and making you click x, x, x, x. Not really fun anymore. Despite this review and their reply, it has gotten even WORSE!!"
56,"Two years ago, 5 star. Now, don't waste your time. Every bad review here is why I deleted the app. I used to buy the season passes and maybe a little extra here and there. Very disappointed in the direction the app has taken. I check here every so often to see if ratings/critique has improved, so that maybe I can go back to playing one of my favorite games, but, it just gets worse."
57,"Needs to be updated, like new rooms and paint,wall paper, and wood floors that look like the color you choice ."
58,It's fun and remove my stress
59,Didnt even let me play
60,The game it was crazy
61,I am a creative person. This app allows me to dream about other possibilities! To the creators: this is the best app out there! Great job!
62,"This was fun until they introduced the level system. If you don't get x amount of wins each month, you go down in level, loosing access to things you spent money on."
63,Terrible with all the changes
64,"This was once a fun game,but the designer status killed the game. It took away creativity. I haven't played for a few months and don't miss it. The relaxing aspect went away. Pushing through to maintain inventory isn't fun. Reply: Yes, it is optional, and I opted to uninstall."
65,Not much in way of options. The color selection is EXTREMELY controlling to the point it felt like I was being directed and the challenges are not plentiful either.
66,Great game LOVE it but the ads are too much but the game itself PHENOMENAL
67,Love this game I just try to be me in them when I have the black blue and Red colors because they are my favorite
68,Amazing app üëè üòç
69,Can't really design anything decent without buying coins.
70,So calming..yet exciting
71,Love this game very addictive The textures and materials being used are so life like makes you feel like a real designer ... Only downside is the game has a very diverse type of materials and colors yet very few ppl know how to use color and those who dont won't Vote for your designs if you use color often into which I do cause I don't like the typical bland white and beige and brown designs
72,"I always loved this game. Took a break from it and came back to altered game. Although I still like the game, it's more limiting than before and a little less fun."
73,I will stop entering the dual challenges in the morning. It seems like that is when the lower level or who has no level number at all are voting. My challenges are always scored very low when l know my challenge looks better. I think I am just going to call it quits with this game. It frustrates me more instead of enjoying it.
74,Very nice game
75,I absolutely love looking at everyone's designs on every room and even outside. So many beautiful people with beautiful idea and flares for creating with color and art using furnitures from all the beautifully crafted designers. Here everyone gets their talent and craft displayed!!
76,Enjoying this. It does relax you until you see there are not nice people in the game so I deleted it
77,Like
78,"I absolutely love this game!!! Love the creators ideas for themed rooms and events! The only draw backs relating to this game is the how expensive the materials become as you advance to higher levels and if a player cannot afford the season pass it puts a GIGANTIC halt in their speed advancing, and new materials and gifts the player will not receive and many rooms they will not be able to participate in decorating. Game is constantly improving! CREATORS KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK!!!!"
79,This game is really fun! I love choosing the floor and walls and fabrics just like remodeling and staging a house. And I love seeing how everyone else interprets the same room! Different paint or tile can totally transform the energy of a room.
80,too many ads that can cause the game to freeze.
81,"I'm deleting this because without buying certain coins, I can't get very much for designing with. It's very frustrating seeing what's available & not be able to get them. When I do earn some coins, it's a piddly amount that I can't buy anything with. Also, as I understand, if you don't pay to become a VIP, you'll be kicked out of the game in 10 days. Are you kidding?! I realize it's the price we pay for not putting up with ads, but I'd rather watch an ad than pay for every little thing."
82,"I'm not one to get ""addicted"" to gaming apps. I'm a traditional gamer, and I love my consoles. However, I love this game. I can't explain it, but it's I just have fun decorating the rooms, completing the challenges, collecting the items, earning the coins and tokens, and voting on the other designs. Keep it up guys you're doing great!"
83,My skills are getting better the longer I continue to play.
84,I absolutely love to redecorating my house all the time and sometimes I get tired but them I found this app I love it already its so fun!
85,very addictive
86,"I rated this game 5 stars two years ago because I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, since the new update where we can only use coins, it's not fun to play. It's nearly impossible to win or even place in the top 3 of any challenge. With almost no wins, you cannot advance your design status, which means some challenges are locked. The items are so expensive and, with most items locked, the designs are starting to all look the same."
87,"It was fun at first, I even spent some money. It's now becoming a money grubber. It's too hard to unlock new items, and the items are eat up all your earnings. Time to move on and find something else. It's a shame when they mess up a good thing. I know you didn't design the games to be free we get that, but don't be greedy."
88,Awesome üëç
89,"Just started, so far I am enjoying the game. No problems with the app. Lots to choose from and items to buy in the game. A few days in now, still enjoying the game. June 2020 - about a fortnight playing with no problems, but today the game won't load, just keeps buffering. Hoping I don't have to uninstall because the game has the potential to go far. August 2020 - the voting system is frustrating. June 2023 started playing again; was impressed that I was reconnected to my old account. 5-stars."
90,It didn't let me play
91,"This used to be so much fun I had multiple accounts on multiple devices because I enjoyed playing it so much. With each update it just gets worse, and now I only have one acct which I play when there's nothing else to do. Pretty sure soon I'll be uninstalling. It's too bad it's gone so downhill."
92,"The one and only game that I ever play, I love it so much!"
93,Love this game its fun and relaxing
94,"Two years ago when I prayed this app I gave it 4 stars. Now, everything in the app is centered around purchases. Constant popups when trying to play, trying to design, and trying to collect coins. I can't let the kids play unsupervised anymore as they have unintentionally clicked on purchases popups. I like the game but find the rest really annoying. It's not worth the hassle. It's disappointing because in the past I loved designing the rooms."
95,üòÅ
96,Love creating different stuff on the game
97,It's a lot of fun. Very relaxing and I have learned so much about interior design!!
98,"I have played this game for a long time. The updates layely are upsetting. Its much more expensive to play the game now, and it has hurt my gameplay and enjoyment greatly"
99,Fun
100,"My account has been hacked. I no longer receive any credits fir merchandise. I have used this app for nearly 3.6 years. They owe me over 20,000 tokens and 93,000 cash. Thanks"
101,"Hands down, the best home design game, I get very agitated sometimes but I keep coming back for what 3 yrs , great game ."
102,Need to earn more coins faster. For free
103,"Very good interior design program, real graphics"
104,"You know it's really irritating when all of your designs constantly getting 6-10 place when you put your time and effort into your designs and you still end up losing to somebody that's just slopping stuff together that don't even match or go together and I'm sick of seeing black and white and plain colors always winning while there's other people that have nice and colorful designs, it's like some of these people that use black and white and plain colors have no taste for other colors!"
105,"Love the game, I hate the level up system, I just want to decorate and be judged. I'm very competitive, but this game has taken alot of the fun out of it, I hate having limited access to items I've already purchased because a challenge has preselected the items you choose from. I hate the relight rooms, I won't play them. I won't purchase anything else until they give me back and allow me to use all of the items that I've already purchased."
106,"Interesting, then it give error won't upload also doesn't give more options to pick from. Not enough to give the inspiration look."
107,To hard to understand what to do.
108,style homes 90s 80s homes Stranger Things style homes 80s 90s TV show üì∫
109,Like the game alot but it seems rigged . because the votes happen fast ....and they seem to always be against me even when you try your best ....its rigged
110,I really love it
111,"It got from meh to bad. Barely any choice, everything is locked, available only for premium or elite players etc. It's a pay to win, play it if you want to spend hundreds of euros/pounds a month... // Good idea, enjoyable game. However gold and tokens are always in very very short supply, so you can't buy the better stuff, unless you spend (a lot of) real money... Voting and duels are strange, often quite plain or even ugly looking designs win - perhaps it's random if there aren't enough votes?"
112,"This game used to be fun and relaxing. But now it's just expensive and stressful. I hate the introduction of ""levels"" to the game. It locks you out of previously unlocked items unless you play the game enough to get to the highest level to unlock all of the items. The original designer sold out to another company, and this game has only gone downhill since. It's really a tragedy that the new company is running it into the ground. The reviews and stars used to be so much higher for this game."
113,"Gave up and uninstalled pretty quickly as coming in last in every single challenge is not fun, especially when the winners are either the exact same as mine was or don't follow the client requests. Items cost way too much anyway and it doesn't help that every single challenge requires it's own items so you can't use what you already have. Disappointing to say the least"
114,Wow! What a app
115,Bc it too exipendd
116,Worst voting system. Worst designs are always on the top and genuine designs are always on the bottom or last. The worst game I've ever played
117,keeps gliching out
118,This game is controlling my life and I have more time now to do other things. Saving money and not spending it on this so-called game. I hope there will be other people out there that will realize when they give you things it's stuff that you already have. Also I think the game is charging way too much compared to what they give us. Well good riddance game. Thank God he opened my eyes to wickedness...
119,Totally addicted to this game.
120,Love you Jaan
121,Game has become unplayable due to having to click through SO MANY freaking ads and pop-ups trying to entice you to buy in-game currency.
122,Update: This game is like Trivia Pursuit. That board game was popular for about 3 yrs but nobody wants to play a game they can't win. The same rooms are OFTEN repeated and the rewards have all been lowered. My bf doesn't even play anymore. He says he can't get above 7th place if he uses patterns and color. He's tired of using black and white all the time. It's pretty boring at this point.
123,"Nice, very helpful for beginners ‚úåÔ∏è"
124,Addictively amusing and figiting fantastic!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°...ü§≠üòú i have 2 accounts lol üíØ‚ù£üëçüèª‚ô•üëåüèª
125,Love it!!
126,"Game! I have been playing it for some time & spending money to boot! When I asked for help with my Graphics, no one even responded! I feel after the years I've put in, I deserve much more than that! I won't spend another penny until I get what I need! D. Wilson"
127,It's great to pass the time...Not enough good themes.... have to purchase to win...
128,"It was such a nice game before all the unnecessary updates. Now, the game is bias, filled with bots, is unfair. Do not appreciate the coin system. And the layouts(rooms or scenes) have become repetitive. And if they release a completely fresh layout, good luck with trying to submit the design because it will have one material to apply from, which has to be bought with your real cash. Just uninstalled the app. Have fun!!"
129,I got back into my account thanks I love this game it's so awesome
130,I love it best games ever
131,I loved this app and played for years but uninstalled when it became pay to play. After years of earning and paying for a bunch of items I was no longer able to use them. I was only offered a few items to decorate a room which was impossible without buying items I didn't want an without access to my large inventory. What a shame. Greed ruins everything.
132,"I love the game its just sometimes it so unfair cause im the one with the best style there and then im 5th,6th,7 and 8th etc. And also when i use a spicific color i like to keep most of the fabrics that color and when ever i want to choose thay color fabric ot doesnt have that color, so basically i have to restart everything. No hate but i think this game should make everything free, its unfair to pay sometimes for a fabric. But i dont have any other problems with the game so far"
133,"Expensive, you have to buy coins and stars."
134,Brings out my creative abilities!
135,"It used to be fun I spent about 50$ a month to purchase items and didn't pay much attention to how much I am spending now until I started going going over the limit I'd set for myself, now I'm spending 100$ or more and on a fixed income I can't do it anymore. I used to play for fun and to relax, now I'm feeling pressured to win and design for wins just so I can play. It's not that fun anymore. It's still the most ost realistic design game and I do like it but since the update it's a play to win"
136,"Terrible downloaded for the sole purpose of relaxing redecor, what I thought it was supposed to be. Did the first part of the tutorial and that was nice. 2nd part of the tutorial CANT EVEN PLAY due to PAYWALL. I just started playing so I have no coins to pay for decor items, and I can't vote (to get coins) because I haven't finished the tutorial. Absolutely absurd. It's supposed to be free. IT'S NOT. Very shady. Promptly Uninstalled. Not worth anyone's time or money."
137,"I was an everyday player for over a year, but then the monthly competition with all the different decor got annoying. It was also obvious to win the monthly competition you had to pay out of your pocket to even get close to winning. I got so obsessed with game, I spent all our money on few was doing it and so there went all our payment and grocery money."
138,Great game
139,"This game isn't like it used to be. It's a money trap. Just read all the other new ratings. You can only do maybe 2 rooms because everything is so expensive to buy. All the good things are locked and are very hard to unlock unless of course you pay. They're losing all their players that have played for years n years due to everything the new owners have done to this game. Also, my game once messed up took my coins and I turned in a ticket for them to fix it. nothing.. Haven't heard anything back"
140,Fun
141,"The change was not for the better!Use to be so much fun, now it's too many tokens for items"
142,Pretty fun if your into games like this like me
143,"It's fun to play, just wish you could get coins easier."
144,"Fun, creative, relaxing, no ads, great graphics."
145,This is one of the worst games available in this store. They're thieves and liars who have rigged the algorithms making it stressful to play. They're money hungry cash grabbing schemes are illegal. They're hostile towards their own player. Customer service is a joke! This isn't a relaxing game no matter how much they push that lie. They don't know their target base and are turning it into a gambling app. All these positive reviews you see are written by them. A truly disgusting company.
146,not fun and confusing
147,"I love this game, but every time I play it glitches and lags after playing it for 10 minutes. And my phone also starts to overheat at the same time as the glitching and lagging. I have the S21 too. I usually would just blame it on my internet connection, or my phone (i recently upgraded after having a Note 8 forever) but it's not the case. It does this no matter what connection I have."
148,"This is my favorite game of all time! I have been playing it for months, using it to unwind."
149,I love this game so much!.. but i recently have a some issue after i updated the redecor..i can't do the vote and can't open to do any design then after 3 days after updated i can do again..And the sometimes when i do the design the game suddenly become hang and stopped then automatic out.. i do again and the same issue happened..it's always happen.. it's spoil my mood. Please fix it
150,"I used to love this game, but it's just awful now. I've done my own experiments to see whether or not the voting system is fair. It isn't."
151,Poor instructions.
152,Don't download!! This was my go to game during the pandemic.i installed it again last night and I hate the update. I have items that I purchased with REAL money before that I can't use now cause it's locked. I have items that uses are up but I cant buy more cause it's for premium users only even tho I used it before.and I have so much locked things now. Bring back the cash and the ability to actually play the game. There is no way I'm going to use my money to pay for the game the way it is now.
153,When I installed the game it was pretty fun to play but after the tutorial I wanted to change my name. I put in an name and it said someone had already took the name but already took my free try and I ended up wasting 400 star tokens just because someone had already tooken the name. There were no clear instructions how to do things and very hard to understand stuff
154,It is a very nice game but when the other items are locked you only have one choice and this has a large negative impact on your design
155,"Sub par. Played it in the beginning,was awesome, now it's about how much you spend."
156,"I recently installed the game because it used to be fun. It isn't anymore because like many others, I had a lot of items unlocked that I already paid for. I would have to unlock them again and this ranking system is very weird. This is a casual game for me and I don't want to have to spend hours a day to be able to enjoy it. Haven't opened it since the first day because it was so frustrating not being able to make the designs look nice. Designing is not fun anymore on this app, just frustrating"
157,"Forget rich, beautiful colors or giving things depth and personality, the whiter and brighter you make it will get you the higher scores."
158,"App deleted. No longer wasting time and money on it. It used to be enjoyable, but now the same designs are reused over and over. The new rank system can never be achieved due to the ridiculous number of wins you need across a season. All the items you purchased at a specific rank are lost of you go down a rank and although you can no longer access the items (certain floorboards, fabrics etc) money spent on them is not returned. It's just full of ads encouraging you to spend more money."
159,Love this
160,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è
161,Very funn relaxing game Would recomend
162,Best game ever!
163,Love this app very much
164,"It's shocking, first I accidentally put in the wrong age and said I was too young and then I uninstalled it and installed it again and it still said I'm too young:(totally don't reccomend:/"
165,"I love this game. Yes, it has in-app purchases, but it's fun. And yes, I'm a grown woman but it's so much fun!"
166,"whats the point of having coins? cant even redeem them, even if items show a coin price."
167,Fun way to spend your free time....
168,Thank you for your response. üïäÔ∏èü§ç
169,I love this game! It really relaxes me! So much fun!
170,Allows my creative side to life without spending üí∞
171,Love it!!
172,I'm loving this game üòçüíúü§©
173,I need help! My whole profile is gone! Everything! I opened the game and it wants me to straf af the newbie level!
174,Love this game ‚ù§Ô∏è
175,"0 stars. Changed the terms and conditions. I used real money to buy & unlock items. They're now locked again. If I want them I'd have to purchase them again. That is theft! You need real money to advance, but literally everything costs more now too. Negative reviews are deleted on social media. Emails are not answered. All the changes have to do with money, it used to be so fun. I played for almost 2 years. Don't waste ur money. Them replying here is funny, they know what's up. Scamming thieves!"
176,"I love this game. I have been playing for approximately 2 years. But, it has become increasingly expensive to play. Also, you now need a certain amount of wins to keep your level. You pay money for certain items and if you drop a level, you lose the ability to use those items. That's a serious problem for me."
177,Issue is not being handled. Still disappointed. But happy someone finally responded.
178,"So disappointed. I have played this game for years. Got a new phone and installed the game. The app doesn't pick up my login, and I have lost all progress. Needed to start over from scratch...."
179,I love the game but I don't like that you can't vote as many times as you want to cause for poor people that is the only way we can build our money up
180,"Like everyone lately, don't like the rating system. Changing to just coins and limiting voting reduces your chances to play/to win. I miss the way it was before. (Perhaps have a rating system for those who apply & 'just play' for all until we do.) Also, perhaps give away the basics, or make the cost lower than the designer. And the accessories much cheaper than the basics. ATM I am enjoying the Tropical vibe (apt for this moment in the UK), despite my depleted supplies."
181,Perfect
182,Costs to high to continue playing. Not worth it
183,Put it on my new device I just aint tired of it awesome app...
184,"Used to be great but now it's awful. If you don't constantly play you lose everything you've earned. The voting system is crappie if you flick through the results you will see alot of the time the most random, mismatched and poorly designed rooms will come higher up then those who look good and have actually put in effort. You can buy furniture then lose it because your status has dropped due to being unable to play because, you know we've all got lives. I'm leaving its a waste of time and money"
185,"I haven't played the game, but I'm so sick of the LONG, unskippable adverts while playing other games that I came here to give a 1 star review."
186,My favorite songs thing to do awesome app
187,"Why do you have to downgrade our level?! We worked hard for that!!!!! Also, the items have gotten so expensive!!!! I don't win as much anymore which is weird because the less deserving designs win. Is this programmed now instead of real votes???? What are you doing Redecor?? This was the best designing app now it's üóëÔ∏è"
188,"This game went from being the best home decor game to being the worst. When I first installed this game on my phone, there were more items unlocked to decorate with. Like most games these days, you had to be patient enough and win additional materials or pay real money for them. I played quite a bit, won and bought a lot. Like 90% of materials were unlocked. Lost all of it after updating the game! Almost everything is locked now. I shouldn't have to repurchase items I've already paid to unlock."
189,"I just want to say, very badüò§..."
190,I love this game
191,"Would be a great app, but majority of the elegant and good looking items are blocked behind pay/subscription, makes it extremely difficult to create winning designs. Major disadvantage for non paying. Otherwise it has great content and design features."
192,Fun
193,"Lower the price of tokens needed to unlock items... I get that you have to make money, especially because there are no ads in this game for the developer to earn a profit off of. But, you guys have thousands of users spending 6 bucks every season plus side packages to purchase additional coins for an item. You show high-level players what is available to them because they won enough challenges to unlock those items, but the wins are in vain because we still have to buy tokens to access the item."
194,"I tried to stay dedicated to this game but everything has been upgraded except the way you vote. Please change the layout of the way we vote, left to right instead of up and down would be better. Most ppl choose the bottom option making voting unfair. If there's changes I'll actually pay to Play this game!"
195,"Igotthisgame at 9 years old, I really liked it and it really in spiredme and I got my phone took up during state testing like everyone then the teacher slammed down the bucket, mine being on the bottom, aftertesting I got it back it was ofc shattered. I wasn't too high on level but I was pretty good. I have finally decided to get back in and try again. I'm not rating the game itself im rating it how it affected me. Other then that it's soon easy to use so many option I just love it!!!"
196,Been playing it for you very exciting game will sharpen your skills. love it!
197,Really so much fun. Great design ideas and also hasn't got ads.
198,"The pop up ""offers"" are too much. Tried to play just now, had to get through 13 pop up windows before I could do anything. Over it. Uninstalling."
199,"The responses to peoples reviews are a joke. We're all saying the same thing but the people running the game don't care, they just want your money. Been playing for MANY years. I've unlocked so much and lost it all when the game changed. It's way more expensive to play now. Unless you have a lot of real money to drop, you ain't getting nowhere in this game. You have to pay like $10-$15 to keep your place on the podium which is stupid. If you do win, you don't win any materials worth a damn."
