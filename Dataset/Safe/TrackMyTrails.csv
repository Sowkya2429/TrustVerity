nothing works
Track was all over the place. Distance walked was too high from actual. Uninstalled
"Not working properly,I do same route,it's giving different reading!unsatisfactory!"
"Easy to use, super convenient. Definitely recommend"
"Guys, something isn't right with tracking. I use galaxy s21 Fe 5g phone and this app when I go hiking. I use two particular routes but every time this app shows different distance walked. Today it showed that I walked almost 1.5km more than this route actually is. Also same app in same other 2 phones also shows different distances walked but we all went together"
inaccuratte
"Love it, this is such a simple App. So easy to use and doesnt have any unnecessary extras or multiple options. I wish more app was like this."
how do I shut down the app?
it glitches
this app is great it does exactly as advertised and nothing more just as a good app should...
"I cant find any way to enable breadcrumbs so i can see the trail I've been on. Also, how can i keep my facing my direction instead of always pointing north? I'll pay for the full version and give 5 stars if i can see the tracks, otherwise, this is useless for someone biking off trail in the forest."
"so freaking good, exactly what I was looking for!!"
"I haven't used it for much complicated stuff, but for now it's good."
Love the app but I'm unsure of the accuracy of the distance. I did a 10km race but the app said it was 13.5km after I finished. Is there a better accuracy setting that I need?
"Just started, so no definitive data to report, but the UI is very clean, very basic and easy to navigate."
"I appreciate the simplicity of this app. it tracks my trails well without all the barrage that you get from other apps to do goofy stuff like take pictures and create a video of your path and share your progress, etc. Thanks for keeping it simple."
Love this app when it works. Unfortunately it's badly unreliable. Tracks incorrectly or fails to track at all 3 times out of 5. Have updated and reinstalled multiple times with no effect.
love it. GPS only. uses no data. easy. FREE.
This Is The Perfect Solution For Me Whilst I Get My Training Achieved For Upcoming Major Challenge
"This app, at least when used for walking, is grossly inaccurate. It inflates your mileage dramatically. It is completely useless for tracking foot mileage."
"great app, tracks your speed. distance and elevation change"
some days the accuracy is bad. There are times when it actually overstates your distance traveled by 50%
"It was great. Easy to use and has all the features I need. The only problem is it now pauses (with auto pause off) for no apparent reason when you use another (unrelated) app. I have updated it to the latest update available (ver 5). It still pauses, I noticed it pauses when I receive a WhatsApp message, even when I don't open WhatsApp."
"Work's even offline hasle free app best for trail people, MX enduro, running, hiking, gravel bike, mtb dh, mtb enduro and overlanding."
said I had walked 0 miles in 1 1/2 hours. Does not work (in android 6)
Could add dark mode
Excellent! Straight forward. Very easy to use. Provides nice incentive for outdoor activity and exercise for kids and adults.
you can't run the app in the background and still use your phone
I am using this mainly to track my trail on a map. And this app does it well. You can get a sharable link if needed. Trails are also accessible from the online site. I paid for the pro version.
if I have my phone to hand or top pocket of coat to shurt macking suer you getting a sat signal it verey acute to track & marck your path. I have samsung A13.
the best
cell tower triangulation is not smooth...it shows zig zag path and adds distance which is incorrect
the login function does not work
thankyou xcountry skiing @ home in my forest
Great app üëå everything I need
Had some initial problems but got very good and prompt help from developer. Great app.
Really cool. I love all the data it gives you!
A slightly steeper learning curve than I expected for a simple app but it does what I need--track my mileage. I think it will be very useful in setting and reaching fitness goals.
Slow updating of gps position üòî as consilience - bad tracking
Initial test walk was great.
"easy to use, accurate and the tracking map is very good"
"excellent, accurate app..."
it's nice..but when you stop the workout session you cannot trace back the trail. unless you share it on Facebook.
Works well. Accurate.
doesn't show step count when walking
nice app to have simple and intuitive
"easy to use, clear details but accuracy on measuring distance, compared to other apps is slightly questionable."
Started walking a lot recently and became curious what kind of distance I was covering. This app does that very well as well as giving many other little interesting stats. It's easy to use and not covered in ads. Highly recommended
Didn't like this app hardly at all.
"I'm using it on horse rides on unmarked, unknown areas. Works great."
quick and easy
I ride horses and this app is great. friemd has iphone app and we never come out with same thing. I can set odometer in car n turn on this app and they match.
"The application records the gps data, but the so-called analyzes are useless. Scattered values ‚Äã‚Äãfor speed look chaotic and I'm missing the vertical axis. Correlation of speed and climb is also difficult. I would be happy if a vertical line appears between the two graphs where I touch. Even better if I can also see the correlating point on the map. I also find the average speed during ascent and descent useful."
excellent app
can't verify my credit card? says not a recognized brand. Tried discover & Visa?
It drops out too often so doesn't record distance or route but the time/duration of walk continues. Altitude climbed and descended are debatable too
"simple, accurate, no hassles. even I can do it"
"Walked the exact same route twice , first time it logged at 5 miles and today it logged it at 6 miles . I traveled same route in car and it logged at 3 miles. Doesn't seem very good of an app"
This App works well on my Galaxy s21 but I can't find the track on my Galaxy watch 4. It appears to be writing the track but there appears to be no way of finding the track. Your advice would be appreciated. Cheers Mark Thanks for your support - I can now see all of the the reordered tracks on my phone quite clearly üëç
"I gotta pay to download my Workout Stats? Hell no! Aside from that, the app ""WAS"" good."
I was a little sceptical about this app tracking accurately. It's fabulous! Simple and without problems
Worked perfect for 2 months and suddenly my two last runs. Cutting 3km out. i guess it's time to uninstall such a pity cause its real nice easy app
does not work properly. bothers to display ads most of all. too bad.
Not bad. I like that no registration is needed. but results are not zoomable and difficult to read. An export would be nice.
Gives great stats. Seems to be accurate. Ads are minimal. Keeps track of workouts. Shows elevations as well as distance traveled. Easy to use. Metric and English units.
"Great program to track and share hikes, bike rides, and similar activities. Works best if you remember to turn it on BEFORE you start the activity!üòâ"
Gives a different difference everytime I walk the same exact route. Sometimes off by 1km.
"this is a decent app the mostly does what it claims.. however, the altitude calculation seems a bit off. example: on Samsung Note 9, at&t network, at the shore in Southern Oregon, USA, this app shows an altitude of -89 feet. Seems unlikely. similar for the beach at Harbor Oregon. 2022/06/25: Following the update download per the fix noted by MaxSoft on 2022/06/23, it now seems I can no longer get elevation at all."
"Changed review, had to turn off lockscreen sleep, works well"
Very easy and useful fitness app. Really enjoying it. No subscription required and no additional payments.
"Cannot switch from metric to English, seemingly, no way to customize"
It's nice that I can use this app offline but sometimes it doesn't record your trail fully. It records your displacement not your actual trail.
no tutorial for a beginner to learn how to use this app
The app worked great for the first couple weeks and then all of a sudden my 2 mi walk became a 7 mi walk. I went back to using map my walk by under armor and it works much better. really sad. oh well.
I hit start the walk. The time starts but the PAUSE comes up but the distance and everything else does not.
It was great until I changed phone I now get annoyed as I need to know how far gone on my mobility scooter
"Great customer service from developers. Had problems with GPS accuracy mostly due to Android os. Quick response, unfortunately problems persist."
"hopeless, accuracy realy hopeless."
"simple, no frills mileage and time app. I purchased it after second use."
Overall good. But it will be great if you can improve it's startup time (it's 2x slower than likewise apps)and reduce the size of the app(it's 2x larger than likewise apps).
same track & distance different reading each time
the app is easy to use but very very inaccurate for distance. error can be over 2- 3 km for an 8 km trail.
distance recorded is way off and I can not find a way to adjust it. I have retraced several routes with my vehicle and each time the app records the distance times two.
"The constant notifications when I am not using the app are super annoying, and I do not see a setting to turn it off. I will uninstall the app instead."
This is very good app
I use this for kayaking.. it tracks while on water . Works great
Cannot Register for an Account or Login with the app
excellent 4 walking running biking accurate
"I use this app to track my dirt bike trail riding. It works awesome and helps me find my way home with the awesome bird's eye view since I'm nowhere near improved roads. Maybe my use of your app could be an additional market to tap into. Improvement suggestions that I think might be useful to many users would be the ability to thumbtack certain obstacles and alternative ways around them, points of interest, fun spots or great views, intersections, and trail dead ends and the ability share thes"
This makes my second year using this app and so far it has been a great one. I do a lot of hiking and never knew how far I have actually traveled through the woods. With this app I have recorded up to a 10 mile hike and with this app you won't get lost in the woods just follow your trail on the app back to your starting point. Thank you for making such a great app
it does the job real good and with unnecessary things to unlock just for premium users
Incorrect distance measured.
"The best option I've found. Works well, and easy to use. Just wish the map was bigger, and stats included coordinates."
Stops half way through a walk.
awesome app for hiking and kayaking trips. I've been rolling through apps to find a good one to map out my routes. I believe I am done looking!
Fun and informative app! I really like it.
Appears to be accurate and easy-to-use. Like th we various activities that can be made.
"I use this app to track my horse trails, it works great for showing what I need. Thanks"
"Excellent for tracking hiking or biking. Simple to use & tracks distance, speed, etc."
Stop recording when screen is switch off... Super useful ü§î
When it works it's not bad but often just switches off and doesn't like working if other apps are running so listening to music often interfeers with it...I've deleted it now
"I've had this app on my phone for a while, I use it occasionally, I'm not big on fitness! I do like to go for walks if the weather is nice, I find it useful to see how far I have walked. I did notice a discrepancy in the distance I had walked when comparing my tracks with Google earth. I also noticed quite a few people reporting the same in the reviews. The good news is that I played around with the accuracy settings and managed to improve things dramatically. If its any help to anyone reading this I use 10"
"unable to register. password fields, although they match, there's a continual error message"
"Uninstalling in single use, no accuracy, walked for 5km and showing only walking time no distance updated not route was updated, no use Replying to devloper After 14 days over i uninstalled your app and now you are asking to share the exact issue, can you pls explain how will i share that exact issue for you"
Seems to work fine for me cycling and walking so long as when i start it i wait for GPS to get a lock. I paid to get rid of the ads... but i really do not want to pay for cloud access to my workouts... I guess i am glad it wont let me login for whatever reason.
"it's great when it works. about half the time I start it up to track a walk and when I look at it 10 minutes into the walk it has the indicator for an active tracking session but it's not tracking anything, it just stops."
how the hell do you get an Account or log in to this app?
"Gone 1:20 min at 5.63 km, but app only recorded 0.64 km at 6 min and stopped"
did not track my walk. l was in a wood and near a farm.
Seems pretty good so far. Can't tell what the difference is between a hike and a walk. Copes better with tree cover than some other apps
Great tracker easy to operate. Thanks
REALLY like it use for my rides with my horse to track our trail rides and her exercise and speeds ...worked good at accurately recording our speed then just stopped working now doesn't give me speeds or distances very disappointing
"Not very reliable, it distorts and pauses without notice. It flies over the real tracks, one wonders whether he was on an aeroplane! Cannot compare to walking odometer pro and map my fitness!"
"thank you, easy, powerful and free! Top!"
Totally does what I need it to
"this is a good one, easy to use."
"Wildly inaccurate. The app kept adding random gps locations to my actual path. It was free so I won't give it 1 star. If they fix it, it could be a nice app for tracking hikes."
cool stuff maaan
Excellent
"Just downloaded as would like to see how far I run, was just playing around with the app and it said I had run 0.25 km in 5 minutes while I was sat on my sofa figuring the features. Thank you for the reply, can you tell me how the accuracy and movement thresholds work?"
Accuracy terrible. Today I chose to walk only on pathways next to roads. And the map track is totaly inaccurate. It shows that I flew across all houses diagonally. Very dissapointing
It does not track properly.
"The best app ever for walking. I use it all the time to track my walks. Highly recommended, just try it!"
Not bad. I would not pay for it at this point. Sorry guys. I'll come back in 6 months. My issue with it is map accuracy. Your map reports me to 65ft + off. 5 to 15ft is great (Military). 27ft -36ft is about average.
CR_P
The best application for outdoor activity. Great experience. I love the app.
Excellent
Went on 2 hour (7km) walk app said 35 mins (5km) rubbish!!!
"Stops working, not managed to track one successful route."
Beautiful UI and a lot of exercises to choose from that are easy to use. GPS tracking is the most accurate I've used to date.
"Excellent tracking app. It has totally changed my life, been using it a lot."
Very accurate and ease to use. GPS tracking is excellent.
"A great app that helps you not only track your mileage, but your time and pace as well. The app also includes other features that I find very usefull !"
"I use it to create new routes, track live workouts, and review my progress. It has very enhanced and very useful static."
"A great app that helps you not only track your mileage, but your time and pace as well. The app also includes other features that I find very useful! 3) Submit screenshots shown in the example"
"Just does the job for me. Provides a map of the route, distance covered, speeds and many more statistics."
This GPS tracker definitely does more than expected and everything I can imagine I would need. Tracks my activities pretty well.
This is such an amazing app it kept me on track with my exercises and it recorded the distance accurately every time.
Easy to setup and log workouts. You do not have to create an account by linking all of your personal info to use it. Many options & stats.
Does what it says with polish & useful features. Mapping is very accurate. Excellent workout app.
"Great functionality and frequent positive updates. Been my main fitness tracking app now. I've tried many others like Strave, Endomondo, MapMyRun, etc."
"Great, easy to use app. GPS and tracking activities are excellent. Thanks for putting together a solid product and continuing to improve it over time."
"Easy and clear layout, plenty of features and data to look up, doesn't eat up much of the battery. Love the fact that it shows map in terrain mode."
I love this app. I have recommended it to many people. My whole family is using it to keep each other motivated.
Super handy and helps to keep yourself fit. Tracks very well.
Very good GPS tracker app and gives a lot of information. I'm using the cloud website as well to backup my tracks.
The best Endomondo replacement or alternative so far. Keep up the good work!
Nice sports tracker tool. Really useful.
"Very good GPS tracking app, pretty accurate."
"I have tried all other apps like Nike, Runkeeper, Strava, Runtastic, Endomondo etc. and this is the best one being more easy to use and user's friendly."
After close down of Endomondo this one seems to be the best replacement. Recommended.
"I've been trying out Track My Trails, as I'm moving from a Windows to an Android phone which doesn't support my old app. It does almost everything I want, although monthly totals would be nice. However, at first it overestimated distance by up to 40% compared with map measurements. I gradually adjusted accuracy to 100 and movement to 5, and it's now showing distance accurately. Elevation is still not very accurate, but as I live in a flat area it doesn't matter. I'll carry on using it."
A very suitable and necessary app for fitness tracking for man&women.
Don't see a way to change from metric system units.
Nice. The app does what I wanted to do.
Accurate. I really enjoy walks with my dogs and able to track our mileage.
"Really liked this app initially... Until all my routes and other data totally disappeared, without warning. Now it appears that it might be stored in the cloud behind a for-pay service. Wish I had known about the change so I could have archived data before it disappeared. Very disappointed, as it was so nice at first."
Great app! Love the new design!
"Amazing app! Tracks time and distance, plus shows your path!"
Wildly inaccurate.
Very good workout and GPS tracking app.
I've been using this app for quite a while now. I use for both running and walking and find it accurate as far as distance and time are concerned.
I can't change any presets. It only displays partial pages. It also records movement while I'm sitting still.
Once worked great now a 1.5 mile run is tracked as 2.5
"I got surprised, how easy to use and accurate!"
"I like this app. It has many different forms of exercise, is easy to use, and you can see where you're going on the map in real time."
Easy to use and accurate. Lots of great features!
Works without any registration although it is available. Highly recommended!
"It works well, keeps GPS signal without a problem, and isn't intrusive or annoying."
"Great exercise app! Very accurate and solid. If you are looking for an excellent exercise app, you found it!"
Perfect performance tracker. Never let me down.
"Brilliant app for tracking walks, cycling and more!"
Great way to track your workouts and get feedback on the fly. The best tracking app so far.
"Terrible! The first time I tried to use it it failed miserably. After about an hour of walking my neighborhood it showed zero distance, zero elevation change. ... all stats except time spent were zero."
"Good when it works, but that and be very hit and miss. Out of my last 5 walks it recorded and saved 2, crashed twice during walking and recorded about half of the other one. Will go back to my old tracker."
"I used this for 2 treks, second one was further away and a lower elevation than the first. I went past the first hikes spot on the second hike. The second hike shows a shorter distance and 1/3 the elevation change! Accuracy is JUNK making this app USELESS!!!"
On my Galaxy S10 this app stops tracking when the screen goes off so it isn't accurate at all. There are no instructions available I can see. How do I keep it tracking while activated?
"Seemed like a great idea for a frequent hiker, but never worked properly. Distance traveled and elevation woefully inaccurate. Keep searching for a better app, I guess."
"This app randomly stops. I could not figure out how to use it, and there are no instructions."
"Didn't track well at all. Hit start, went on my walk. Walked for minimum of 2 miles and it said I walked .025 miles in 1 hour. GPS Didnt work at all either"
Didn't even map the route. 9mi franconia ridge trail was mapped as a 4.5 mile hike. Smh. Moving on
Right off the bat the app sucks. Did not track distance OR speed.
Stopped working haven't thought about this app in a long time until suddenly repeated pop ups asking for a rating.
Very helpful when trails aren't well marked. Fewer ads that interrupt voewing would be nice.
This app works extremely well for tracking how far I've gone and how long it's taken.
"This app is wonderful! It is everything I need to track my walks and runs. I would give it 5 stars, but there is one annoying hitch: Every time I open the app, it logs me out and offers an error message. The tracking, however, is accurate and easy to run in the background while listening to music on my walks. Thank you for this wonderful app!"
I loved it until I could not shut off the info in preparation for my next walk! So I had to uninstall.
"My cat, Chairman Meow, loves this app. Every time she steaks my phone this app is open and running. Tip top!"
"I love it - distance, time and a map. Easy to use. Can label the trip and can upload it. All good."
"Use this for horseback riding and works well and is easy to use. Tracks my trails, time, speed...everything I need."
Good enough
A load of rubbish I attempted to to track and got a map in Rome this app is a disgrace.
I would og gave this app negative star if possible.
This is a great app. When I did have a question they were there to answer my questions the same day. When I did have an issue they fixed it immediately! Great service. Highly reccommend this app.
"Wow this app has so many advanced features. So useful for hiking, walking or cycling and it is FREE!"
"Great app, just what I need, easy to use, & none of the clutter some other tracking apps come with & it seems accurate."
Had location on running and after 45 mins said I had run 2k
"The app does not appear to measure my walking distance correctly- I get different measures for the same distance . How can I correct? I really hope I can fix it because otherwise I really like it- it's simple, quick and easy and would give me the info I need."
"Simple, easy, reliable"
The best tracker app
"The app tracks my running and cycling so accurately, I rely on it so much to keep a record of my activities. Wouldn't take part without it now!"
