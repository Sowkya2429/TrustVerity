0,i should have been had one
1,works great
2,"Doesn't work, connected it multiple times and still doesn't acknowledge the link has been made. infuriating"
3,This app doesn't work.
4,"Where do I begin? Ease of use, great synergy between my devices, and multiple Alexa units in my house and other family members' homes. Great customer support! They remain with you until your issue is resolved or provide you with additional options. For me it works. I am constantly finding new ways to get the most out of Alexa app. Amazon does a real good job suggesting ways to enhance your experience based on your daily routines."
5,I love this aap
6,Scope for Interface improvement
7,I wish I can play my resent son added on my play list instead of skipping each son until I reach the new ones.
8,very good
9,she has stopped responding to her
10,bad
11,Perfect üëç
12,exelent
13,kindly update the features. mobile to Alexa connect with aux cable
14,Was a very helpful one thanks.
15,"Can't connect Alexa to wifi or Bluetooth to my PC. Tried many sets of instructions. Cannot find Alexa app for PC. Amazon says to download it, but I can't find it. I think I'll return the Alexa I purchased."
16,slow and not great response or problem solving options
17,bikram
18,"Recently replaced my Google Home with Amazon Ecoh Show but it's disappointing. Very limited options with Alexa, listening is not good, and cannot play from Youtube automatically."
19,good app
20,They need to make this more innovative its like they half assed it when programing. Something that should just work does not.
21,"The app works great for me except one issue I am noticing. Whenever I change the audio settings on my devices, the settings are automatically reset back to zero. Annoying.."
22,useless if there's background noise
23,thank you
24,Doesn't help me at all.
25,too pushy trying to sell they're services
26,App is not user friendly in any way.
27,need to be fixed I cannot do anything with my phone if I'm using Alexa to read a book to me which is really annoying don't like the few updates that has happened so far have to keep the app open in order to keep listening I should be able to use my phone and do other things while the book is being played in the background
28,What's the deal with having to use the app and not the web browser version? I want the browser version back!
29,good and easy
30,xbox gamer here
31,lousy at controlling speakers
32,"Good job removing the energy consumption of smaller devices. Small things do not matter, at least for Amazon. The application is responding slowly, is becomes more and more robust. I don't like it. I am considering changing to other smart home assistant."
33,junk don't buy
34,I'm just tired of this app not understanding any commands.
35,I love my Alexa but the app needs a lot of work. I'd like better organization on my Kindle book list since I like to use my Alexa to have it read to me
36,Update - playing music is horrendous. I have never had such a terrible experience using an app to stream music to my Alexa devices. It freezes and displays wrong song info. It's amazing how many years it has been like this too. SMH. One of the worst designed apps I have ever used. This app is a mess. It's confusing with the worst UX and UI imaginable. Nothing is intuitive and you basically get lost trying to find settings.
37,"AWFUL BUG after last update. Levels keep changing on dot devices which didn't happen before. Keep having to readjust everytime I turn them on now. SAME with all lights and routines. Very frustrating, please fix."
38,Connection and Audible Issues.
39,super
40,nothing works
41,good
42,app not working correctly. weather alert but not listed on the app
43,Poor sound quality
44,it has so many options and information. very confusing for starting few days.
45,Amazing voice
46,Nice
47,Faltu
48,app is not responsive to touch and there is lag and so slow
49,Great way to listen to all your favourite music
50,It's so painful that it took 2 days to detect and connect to wifi and setup my alexa device . Can anyone tell me why I am not able to make call from alexa to my any mobile number through voice assistant.. it says can't make calls ..
51,So bad!I can't even get started 0 stars
52,the app is great and allows you to do a number of things my Google home mini can't do. Alexa is limited in some ways and the voice options aren't as great as I'd like and I haven't found a voice match setting yet to personalize responses from different people but otherwise I'm satisfied
53,I received help from an Alexa rep that fixed my connection issue very effectively and efficiently. Thank you so much!
54,üëç
55,LOVE IT ‚ù§Ô∏è
56,Not user friendly. I bought it so that'll ring louder since I work on call. Does not ring at all
57,fair
58,anmolveer
59,Hell ya
60,didn't connect
61,"Good for setting timers and telling you the weather, but often times it doesn't even listen or open the apps that I ask it to open."
62,"Honestly, I wasn't interested in having one but after using one while babysitting, I definitely wanted one!After getting my first one I was amazed at how much you can do/get with it, I loved it so much I now have 3 in different rooms and thinking of getting another one üòÄ Everything is so easy about it from the start with setting it up, as I'm not a technical person but it's SO EASY even for me! I use it for many things and I'm still discovering new things that you can do with it, THANKS!"
63,Alexa keeps going off when playing radio stations
64,Simply cool
65,From some days I m unable to use hands free Please solve my problem
66,nice app
67,"can't remove family devices, imagine people randomly adding your account to family and then hacking you. shame"
68,Most things are fine but it keeps getting a network error when trying to change settings on an echo show which I have to do a few times a day because that is the only way to keep my child from being on it ALL the time. You can restrict kids on a kids echo but not on an adult echo. It doesn't make sense.
69,I don't know my password so it's not connecting
70,good
71,Nice app
72,üòÉ
73,Una porqueria no la recomiendo te.pone muchos examenes
74,Good Protect
75,"It is still educating me. I'm not sure of it's capabilities, or mine."
76,Alexa app is very good. A little confusing with the music part sometimes but apart from that really good.
77,good
78,You can't even login They say that the OTP has been sent but I can't get that OTP for login FIX THAT!!!!

85,not working
86,can't use properly
87,Just doesn't work a lot of the time. It never seems to improve either.
88,It does not respond to my questions.
89,it does the bare minimum and gets the job done
90,I love it
91,not very helpful
92,Understanding English and Portuguese is not seamless
93,I don't want anyone to see my info without my consent. if anyone needs this info ask me first.
94,"I got a Amazon Alexa supersonic SC, ya know the square tower device, well anyways I cannot find it anywhere in the Alexa app and I'm so confused, I really need help, cant find anywhere, I can't find device and have it connected to my internet, otherwise this app sucks"
95,Incredibly buggy. But there's no alternative
96,So far so good only time will tell.
97,A nt cone to Alexa
98,Sugaswife22
99,"Appears to have a mind of it's own! Repeatedly sends random notifications, echo device EQ settings reset themselves, a far from intuitive UI. Effectively just a 260mb kitchen timer."
100,"I love it, weather reports, reminders, plays my music, and so much more. And now she reads your books to you! Very happy."
101,Good other than some weird device integration limitations. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
102,Had it for 2 minutes and it crashed ever 3 seconds !
103,I'm really enjoying this outdated version of Amazon's Alexa echo dot I have the 3rd generation black hockey puck looking one my only complaint is the maximum volume is abysmally low and also i don't have many smart devices to link up with it ATM but nonetheless I'm still enjoying hands free calling groceries and to-do lists music unlimited photo storage news broadcast and Much more!!!!
104,"Unable to delete ""recently played"" from list. For some reason it just started playing a random fasting podcast and continues to randomly start playing... I WANT IT REMOVED!!!"
105,not responding properly in my mobile. came with inbuild
106,No YouTube music
107,won't allow me to add new wifi
108,"When it's not being sarcastic, it's incompetent and unhelpful."
109,why can I play music on both the built in speaker and the Bluetooth speaker
110,best
111,"finally bought one of the echo alexas, and I'm loving it so far. props to the technicians"
112,useless and annoying. I received as a gift. I don't understand why people want their privacy invaded. I used this useless piece of junk for one day only
113,Horrible interface. Unintuitive
114,App is useless.
115,good
116,still learning to use it
117,Helpful very helpful.
118,lo mejor

141,good voice control app
142,Awful app
143,üëç
144,stop playing music for no reason & shows multiple active devices when it stop playing music even if you turn on loop mode.
145,crashes doesn't do what she says ok to. hangs Irish accent never materialised dispite launch. is clearly evident it's a project heading for the scrapheap.
146,When I say turn on lights it now turns on my plugs that are not lights. The music is still bugged. This needs fixed thanks when it's fixed. I say it's be a 4 or 5 üåü and last but least the Energy consumption update that's coming Is fail.
147,Does not work in my region
148,good apps
149,fabulous. could not be without it
150,"Lame is the least. You have Amazon Prime, but you do not want to get Amazon Music. It is my option. When I ask it to play some song, it is playing it, but adds ‚ÄùShuffling the (song that you said)‚Äù. When stupid people get greedy it is the definition of Amazon as a (donkey?)whole. So, yea, I am still using Prime, getting what I want from Alexa and ignoring your stupid communication ideas. :)))"
151,My experience is normal because after sometime after sometime after login my type to Alexa button is disappear suffix this I want to type in the Alexa
152,awesome
153,Good Amazon Alexa
154,nice
155,outstanding app
156,it's good
157,App does not allow you to delete it information including conversation history.
158,my Alex connected then disconnected and now says it can't find my device. when I got in right next to me.
159,üëç
160,"Connection when calling/video keeps dropping, very frustrating. Both ends have excellent wifi too!"
161,"It's does not let me get on the app at all. It just keeps on saying that I have no internet when in right next to my wifi box, and I also have mobile data. If I could rate this app lower, it would be a 0. By the way, make sure you have an Alexa before getting the app because that will get really annoying."
162,good
163,only 2 stars when it comes to understanding the commands and speech recognition plus it lags alot
164,annoyed the children can't play their own playlists on their own children's dots at the same time!
165,good
166,"Update: Alexa is just as bad as it ever was. It's like 1,000 people are working on the app, but no one is talking to each other! Have they ever thought about putting help in ALPHABETICAL ORDER?? I'm going to check out Google nest."
167,good
168,"Made sure the my echo device was up to date and my app was also up to date, wifi connection is good and i don't see any Hardware problems but my echo dot just USUALLY not even sometimes because its becoming more frequent now, does not respond to voice commads. Have to hard reset it all the time and thats just getting annoying. Billion dollar company and can't get their devices to function well."
169,wah
170,Excellent app for AI lovers.
171,"STOP CHANGING THE INTERFACE. Everytime I think I've mastered the app you guys push out another one making it difficult for me to set alarms for my echo via my phone! But other than that, it can be useful that's why I give it a 4, but your pushing it. *Please make it easier to set alarms via mobile instead of me having to go on a safari mission to find it everytime.*"
172,Recent update broke connection with Ring cannot connect my doorbell anymore
173,really like Alexa and echo a lot of fun good for learning to
174,Echo wouldn't connect to wifi. They sent a second device. That one won't connect to wifi. Weird considering my 3rd gen has no problems at all doing that. Everything else in my home is connected to wifi and working fine. It isn't the device. It's the app. Read them they all have similar issues. And talking to the chat function is a joke. They will all tell you to do the same thing. They can't actually help you. I'm getting a Google nest.
175,Rocking
176,good
177,"Trying EVERYTHING to connect my Phone, Echo Dot & JBL BLUETOOTH SPEAKER all to my Amazon Echo Dot üò± Not getting HELP w/ this issue‚ÄºÔ∏è"

179,amazing and spectacular and awesome Victorious and prosperous
180,Very good
181,It's the best app in my life ever
182,"Used to love it. With each upgrade, I have disliked it more. Its a complete battery pig even on the maximum battery saving settings. An upgrade is supposed to improve an app - bring positive changes, not make people want to discontinue it however that's exactly what has happened especially with the June 2023 update. The worst yet!"
183,rude people
184,Not working in proper and worst AI
185,good job alexa
186,its a nice app
187,great
188,"Great App, tremendously helpful"
189,I love Alexa!!
190,It doesn't show any services aside Amazon music. Useless
191,Horrible product. Never powers up even after unplugging and there is no one to help me
192,I like the old version
193,This app could do with more instructions with setup and login. Far to many creators take it for granted that everyone has a simple understanding of setting up devices with vague instructions. Not everyone has easy understanding of setup devices. Otherwise this is a good app. it has potential.
194,i can't conect a device
195,poor understanding
196,good
197,There has been a very annoying bug for over a year that forces me to enter my name every time I open the app
198,"With many devices, it's so unresponsive it's barely usable."
199,it's always fun with Alexa.
200,good
201,Good
202,Takes forever to change a password on a echo. Almost impossible to figure out how.
203,my echo dot 4th gen didnt display the time
204,no wifi setting available

223,"Dear Amazon, Thank you for fixing the speaker group issues. Today, I was finally able to group 2 echo devices successfully, which are completely in sync. The one problem I do have is none of my FireTV Cubes 1st or 2nd generation will group play. What I did notice, neither displays what network they're connected to like my echos when i attempt to create a group with the Cubes. I've tried resetting them, but nothing appears to fix the issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."

228,"For such a wealthy company, the app is LAME. It's slow to initiate, slow to make changes and half the time it closes without notice. They already took away the ability to ask for specific music. How cheap can you get?"
229,the best üëå
230,I didn't know it had all this stuff
231,good
232,best üíì
233,"After 2 years the hue bridge and Alexa need to be reconnected (has to be added as a skill again) so I was a few days without Alexa controlling my lights before I understood what was going on (no prompt in the app to say otherwise) now it won't let me reconnect, says there is an error and to try later. I am currently 2 weeks in trying to sort this with CS and now I ha e been brushed off saying it is Hues issue and to contact them. Hue works fine with google and all other non Amazon products"
234,very nice device...I m surprised
235,good
236,"I used to look forward to saying, Alexa...good morning! I would get day, date, time, traffic, weather, news would be basically brief like headlines, then hear Mama Joyce then end with Bible verse for the day. Now it's the news podcast for this and that, then this and that again, I have no ideal how this SUDDENLY happened, very frustrated. Can't seem to get back . Thinking it's time to switch everything over to Siri, maybe she won't change my routines at HER convenience like Alexa does üò≤"

239,"It's ok, but the settings keeps changing or refreshing. The app is mostly fine for editing some things like alarms or names but when I checked the aux cord settings are gone, when I tested it it won't connect, sure Bluetooth can be used but having the option taken is just tiresome."
240,"Unintuitive, and constantly moving functions below more and more levels of menus."
241,awesome
242,"very poor product by amazon. it can play using one device only, if you want from another then app required & connecting a device & setup is too much pathetic & time taking. worst decesion buying alexa."
243,Opo
244,"You ask it to play Chapter 12, it plays 84. Ask it to play C12, it plays 70+. Ask it to pause and resume and it jumps around in the book. As for music, it constantly tries to play compilations and alternatives to what you ask for."
245,It's amazing app I love
246,so best
247,Superb
248,"Some of the directions are unclear, alexa is still unhelpful"
249,Average needs improvement as app gets hang frequently

252,uncool. doesn't do a thing for fire stick. what a joke!
253,so far no complaints

264,I love the Alexa device. I no longer have to walk into a dark room to get to.my bed at night.
265,So useful
266,"I paid for the device, Yet some how Amazon found it a brilliant idea to create the ""by the way"" prompts which is a cancerous marketing scheme. And no, you can't indefinitely turn it off. Give an order to stop.. It says SNOOZE. Sending echo back and getting the Google one."
267,doesn't work with my tstat
268,it stopped working when I got google record trace
269,Still having problems with my surround sound and Echo sub. All the way down from a 5-star to a 2 Star 1 star y'all are lucky I can't give you guys a 0 star. No one doesn't want to fix anything on this app! I give up im Selling my Echo surround sound. It's just not worth the headaches.
270,love it
271,"I get notifications through Alexa from the National Weather Service, but when I open them, Alexa won't show me the message."
272,too invasive
273,can't connect youtube
274,Very good.
275,it works when it wants too and stops working when it wants too
276,this is a very reliable device
277,"I love Alexa! She saves the day for me pretty much daily lol but lately she doesn't understand what ""no"" means and I'm not quite sure why. When I tell her no, like for instance when she asks me to upgrade something) she says ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" it's becoming quite annoying. She's also stopped doing her hunches with my lights and I really count on those. Please fix her"
278,very help timer
279,Terrible. Jumps around chapters without any reference to what's requested. Loses its place and resumes from the start. Can't find well known media eg Steely Dan. Asks for a code which it doesn't send.

340,stop asking for my password everytime i connect to the internet! if i am signed in to my devices it is probably me using it!
341,"Very helpful. In my one bedroom apartment I have two Echo Dots, One Echo Show, two tablets and my phone all with Alexa installed. I wish the devices were all ""on the same page"" always. Sometimes it seems that the less used devices don't get the memo, or get it late."
342,response is great to my voice
343,awesome for me!!!!
344,I love Alexa communication very helpful and easy to use would recommend to family and friends
345,I forget to use it. This is a big help.
346,Love it!!!
347,"Constantly need to be fiddled with the work. Devices change wifi networks, drops music for no known reason, etc, etc."
348,Really terrible app. So bad I can't believe it's not a joke. Very slow and glitchy. Amazon should be embarrassed to make people use this. Zero stars.
349,Alexa is ok. But don't have the ability to find songs that you're listening to.
350,Connection problems
351,cluttered complicated set up
352,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
353,Buggy and alow
354,terrible
355,"Love ‚ù§Ô∏è my Alexa, I love having a DJ on standby, parties, sports, etc. If someone puts out some incorrect info, Alexa is right there to correct them if needed. Lol"
356,bahut badhiya
357,love alexa
358,every day the system is can't cope
359,Junk. Still junk a year latter. Should be droped by amazon.
360,keeps losing connection when played from my phone.
361,"The search bar was back on top yesterday, and it was great!! Now it's back at the bottom, and it is so annoying!!"
362,not responding when the app is closed in the phone
363,Works great.
364,"Most things work brilliantly, but recently some routines that used to work no longer work, so a star dropped. For example, I have set a sleep routine for every night. Alexa tells you a good night phrase, switches the TV and lights off, and then plays sleep music. This now no longer work. Blueprints no longer work. Announcements from Ring have stopped too"
365,good apps
366,ok
367,not support my device alexa redmi note 10 pro
368,Issues - and doesn't provide easy trouble shooting to resolve.
369,"No Way this app is 4+ star. Has awful lag , often never showing active skill or artist being played on ECHO . Cannot or will not STOP active MEDIA when it decides to play offensive vulgar media, I try to stop/ change , & ECHO conts. play vulgarity . Voice response is awful either too slow or too fast. Devices connect to the wrong WiFi , & will not stay connected to new WiFi! Often says devices are DISABLED w/o reason. Now Solved! and Thanks to a 3rd party text app that actually commands ECHO!"
370,love ‚ù§Ô∏è
371,üòò
372,great
373,ok üëå kk99 6!7+‚ù§Ô∏è#>‚ò∫Ô∏è now jk
374,"Constant Battery Drain, Can NOT turn off Alexa looking for Nearby devices! Zero support, even turning off the Notification still drains Battery, App take seconds to make selection or load. Long longer with use of connected SmartThings"
375,It's great also Amazon I have Google play on Kindle ha ha
376,keep good work
377,Don't Download - Absolutely useless. It's slow.
378,Alexa keeps engaging my phone even though it's turned off. it's truly infuriating!
379,Excellent
380,Wow
381,Mujhe yah bahut pasand
382,bluetooth
383,great
384,alexa is fun and nice instrument
385,"having set up an echo dot yesterday and listened to music through it, I find today I have to set it up all over again üò° light bulb in my bedroom also stopped working a long time ago"
386,I love this app so much
387,"Connection problems appear to have been resolved. This is my go to app for all things music and podcasts while driving. I pair it with Amazon Music exclusively. My only remaining issue is that while paired to Amazon Music I lose control of the volume which appears to be set by Alexa. When I ask Alexa to increase/decrease the volume, nothing happens. The set volume at times can be too loud. There is no work around or I haven't found it yet. I'm still investigating. It may be Amazon Music."
388,"I find it to be an overwhelming app, the settings are difficult to navigate. So far I'm yet to figure out how to stop Alexa announcing Bluetooth connection. I managed to stop the speaking part of the announcement after months and months of sporadically ""giving it another go"", but there is still a notification sound which I can't seem to find a setting for and if I've forgotten to turn my laptop Bluetooth off before shutting it down, then Alexa disturbs the whole house when I go to use it again."
389,Great Job üëç.
390,very good app
391,such nice app
392,easy to use
393,"After latest update, Alexa stop working with all smart appliances like syska smart home bulb, TV, smart switch etc. Very bad experience üëé"
394,still working it out
395,Makes having a smart home a lot easier.
396,Not working very well
397,good app
398,Annoying
399,"I'm tired of the Alexa system in general overriding skills I've set up with other skills. For example, up to a few minutes ago ""play Scala radio"" played Scala from the correct skill (the specific Scala radio skill). Suddenly, Alexa decides to play the station via TuneIn, thus losing all my premium content"
