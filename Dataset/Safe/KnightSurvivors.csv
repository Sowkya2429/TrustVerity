"For few days i play no problem. But since tonight the game crash twice when i play. Cost me energy, count for daily challenge. Shame, want to play longer."
"I've only been playing a few minutes but so far, I think it's pretty fun."
Good for relax
Saw the energy system and immediately uninstalled
I think 3 stars only coz using long range weapons like rifle means nothing since the range of mob detection is the same as close range And all weapon skill is joystick direction except for staff & catalyst Daily challenges get harder with each suppression stage won I think Edit: I just found out boss hit box is small and literally the Centre of the boss.. Character hit box is bigger than image and attack of weapons sometimes dun trigger coz range is small
Very good
Short-lived Vampire Survivors clone. If you're looking for skill based game turn away now. The difficulty per level requires you to grind on equipment and gacha items. It has the body of Vampire Survivors without the soul.
Why are there 2 BGMs? One cannot be turned down no matter what
"I realy love this game, love pixel too"
fun game. keep reach to the top level
"Great time-killer, I have a hard time setting it down! üòÇ"
"They had a non ad version for 10 Euros, they they changed it making it a monthly pass, google won't refund me, I still have to watch ads for rewards and didn't even got a monthly card for it, also is not worth to pay 10 Euros per month for this game. In the current znes graphics state that it is."
it's a very nice Game and enjoyable
I've played various games of this same gameplay mechanic but this is the first that has a very different element: party members that effect your abilities. That is a first for me and a good first at that
Fun but game is lacking
"Please make it so the revive window you have to press X somewhere , if you are moving with small drags i keep ""tapping out"" of the revive screen unintentionally its bad design"
Nice
Great game & fun to play but where is the fixed joystick button. Feeling really uncomfortable with the control right now.
Really fun but the game got a lag to it runs really slow and freezes up
Best
Good for wasting time
Game stuck at loading screen and does not load.
Cheat detected lmao
"The game is amazing and I Love it, but I wish that if you make it faster like 3 times or 4 times gameplay speed ‚è©Ô∏è"

There is nothing that makes this game unique compared to all of the other games built exactly the same way. Blatant money grab
I try download in 2 device my phone and nox in PC I can't start the game so... That's it
"Hard to run, but addictive. There's no forced ads, only those you choose to watch for currency or lives, and the Vampire Survivor game play is amazingly addictive. The art and characters are cute, but there's a few translation issues. If the game didn't make my phone heat up so much, it'd be an all time favorite."
Every time I try to play my game always freezes at intro when ur about to play It was so excited to play but I keeps freezing
"idiot bug, stuck after kill last boss. There's no trigger event finish/clear to end/exit stage after kill last boss."
"I realized that during my time playing, there isnt much to gain exp, its usually just the main and patrol but nothing much else with may make others noy being about to complete the 7 day quest"
Good üëç
doing pretty good but right now there is only 1 skill that deal pretty good damage other was useless and if you dont have that skill evolve or not getting it on certain minute you lose for sure need rebalance.. most bossfight are skill depending rather that main weapon hit/skill
"I haven't play much which is loading and goes automatically exit, maybe is my phone doesn't compatible ""Huawei Y7 PRO""."
Mob!!!!
A thumps up
Very enjoyable
Best
cant play ads..ad unavailable ((edit)*game working great now thank you for the update*)
Yay
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
the game is very good ehehehe
"I like the twist on the genre of having a large group of characters fighting with you. I dislike how much it feels like they want my money, there's way too many membership-based things that could all have been one thing. Not sure if it's because it's my first day playing, but I've gotten zero ads, even when selecting to watch one for a reward."
Best
I'm liking this. Has a fun atmosphere and a good vibe to it. My only issue with it is that it sometimes crashes but it doesn't happen that often and the game is still playable. I like that you can add a 'party' to your character.
"Game don't open after update Problem solven on its own after a while, maybe it was connection problem. So up to 4 stars because i like the game. The 7 first challenge is impossible tho, no way to reach lvl 18 or 21 in that frame of time."
"Though this game has a auto continue feature if you disconnect to close the program, it doesn't really matter if it lags to the point of no frames. After a couple of restarts, the automated will crash and you'll lose all progress."
Im actually enjoying this game. And i really am hoping to play this iin ios. Keep this game going and growing
"Can't view ads. Can't revive. If u die in daily dungeon u lose the chance to play it. This is unfriendly to new player. I found a new problem after playing for a while. On level 19, after the first boss, there is a new type of monster that can throw fire at u. The fire is at a long range and can't be blocked by the wind upgrade. There is no way to pass that one. I don't know what the designer is thinking when designing the level."
Great
"played a few games, got potential. then tried playing again. loading game at the start crashes. then when im able go load in. all buttons does not function. uninstall. this game should still be in development. rushing to launch the game for this to happen. remember once a gamer tried the game and uninstalls it. little to no chance they will install it again."
Fun
"New update in game, lead me to this page but no updates at all... One Star bruh"
nice gamr
"I really like it so far, cute characters, smooth graphics and faster paced than other survivor games. The music is good, but gets a bit repetitive. Good job, devs!"
"Good game but the ads system is always unavailable to watch,please fix it"
game play really fun but I found Access block game has not completed google verify process. please fix.
"If you gonna play this game, laser focus on the newcomer event. I couldn't complete it. There's no option to reset account progress, no extra servers. Not sure if I will continue. But up to where I played was solid, they handle ads well, the progression feels well paced. I needs more content, more skills combos, right now it is just not enough."
"unusable ads feature, bugged perks roll, and sometime my character just died absurdly."
Nice
"Good game, but a lot of lag in the menu EDIT : seems to have been fixed :)"
"One of those games where you go "" just one more level..."" Pretty decent"
Love it very fun for me and my kids
"Why do tasks that are impossible to complete? reward for 7 days, it is not possible to receive it, too many levels to level up. Why do this?"
"Enjoying this game so far compliments to the developers involved , There is a minor issue the app randomly freezes when I make it to a large wave of enemies my phone specs Redmi 11 4g ram Snapdragon 680 octa core 2.40ghz it definitely cannot be the phone please check out if possible thanks."
Dev already fix the crash issue after read my review.. so i give them 5‚òÖ for their quick response... üëç
4 stars for quick response and for actually not just giving some lame excuse saying you dont know what the problem is. Lagged froze then shut down on me o
"Well, this game could be my next wasting time type of game while waiting in line"
Shess
"The worst, stressed me up, so lag... They tried to download ads while you play. It's lags both connection and fps loss!"
"Ads always unavailable, i can't complete the 7-days mission because of it. please do something."
Cool game
Your Beginners Daily Quest is absolutely not beginner friendly ive been grinding alot and cant level up to 21. waste my 7 days of playing
"Lmao, tells me to update game, redirects me to playstore, playstore has no updates, trash."
always crashing. cant finish a game without crashing
"Good in concept, but not fun to play. Gameplay drags a lot and levels are way longer and easier than they probably should be. Game tends to freeze up and stop working towards end of rounds, which is annoying and wastes my time. Burns up my phone battery too."
chill
Yeahboi
"Played to stage 4, but suddenly disconnect and can't played at all because it stuck at loading screen no matter how long i wait"
Zzzzzzz üò¥
game freezes my phone cant play it lame game delete it
Constantly disconnect on 100mbs network... On a game that has no business being exclusively online. Uninstalling.
"It always freezes on me, n when I do the suggestive battles it keep losing connection exits out of it n then I have to restart"
"Just testing the waters, but after certain point of the game. The speed becoming slow and the game starting to get hang. The control give no responsive. No worth it. You can get bored in second."
Delay if lots of monters arrive.
brilliant!!!
"Game tells me there is a newer version and to update, but playstore tells me i am up to date and there is no more updates so i can't play anymore because game ask me to update to something that dont exist."
"It's a great idea and game to make , keep it upü•∞"
Love the esthetic and gameplay itself but there's not much content and the frame rate like to dip a lot. It can be hard to play when there's a 3-5 second delay in your input due to the extremely low frame rate at times but this games got a lot of potential. I hope the devs add more content and smooth out the frame rate a bit.
"One of the better games of its kind, definitely recommend. Needs some slight balance tweaks, but still great"
"Boring, little to no strategy involved. Don't waste your time."
"Fun game but I wanted to point out 1 Bug during the boss battle (Knight) he did an attack that has knockback but what happened was I was near the edge of the playable map and the attack pushed me out of bounds, not that it bothers me just pointing out a bug."
It would be 5 star if some mission is to pay money... and so far its been a great experience
Can't stop playing.
enjoy able finish my cigarettes and happy back to work
Thanks for fixing the bug. I didn't expect it to be that quick but that was awesome of u. I was just starting to like the game.
"I love the game, it's fun. However, every time I load into it it gives a didn't work/responding message. It also lags a lot, still playing when it allows me to though."
Always Disconnected R.I.P game wasted time
Animal ka
purchased weapon but game crashe but was already charged
"Codes 2023 , 2024 , 2025"
"Everything is great. The SFX, music, and game play. I wish I could play without wifi, but it's still a good game."
I'm giving this 1 star because it lag's after 1 million monster inter the field fix this you stupid asses.
Games keep crashing a lot and asking to update the app even though i've updated the app
"So far this bullet survivor style game is my favorite after vamp survivors on mobile. It's a bit short though, but overall it's fun. It plays very smoothly and I like the character art. I wish it was B2P though, just a single payment and remove ad promts, but it isn't so I can't give it 5 stars."
Gameplay is ok but keeps disconnecting.
"Honestly, a very good vampire survivor game"
The most ugliest trash and worst game n playstore ever!
Nice new update love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
"2 time, no enemy at all and there is no end. I uninstal the game spontaniously"
Was fun until the actual first stage when final boss is not showing up. Just wondering an empty stage.
What's with this game? I just downloaded it but it won't open 'cause it says there's a new update and I have to update it here on playstore. Kindly fix this.
Giving only a 2 star because stage 1 and 2 are easy and immediately in stage 3 it's insane mode. Every monster in the wave releasees a pool or venom that drains 20% hp so we can't move around. And we're provided more offensive perks instead of equal number of offensive and defensive. It's almost impossible to proceed without paying your way forward.
Nice gameplay but fkingly keep CRASHING!!!
Okay the new update made everything better. Loving the new art and the game looks smoother.
Yeah baby
Looking better
Bad updates this game pay to win / pay to fun not for free future
"The monster is really hard to be killed, the level is really crazy hard, you need the highest level of equipment to finish the chapter, cause the monster is really strong, so I give you 2 stars, because the balance of the game is broken"
"Masih bayak bugnya,quest kadang tidak bs diselesaikan,daily chalange chest ke 3 kadang ga bs ke buka padahal sdh clear diulang jg sama aja"
Boring
"It was fun before the latest patch. The game become harder to play, almost pay-to-play. Weapon drop rate is very low. Did 10x2 loot and only get 1 Rare weapon. Others is just normal level. Starting from level 6, monsters hard to kill and have poison effects after died. Sadly this game is a disappointment."
"Once you reach chapter 4 or 5, it's almost impossible. All enemies drop poison pool, it feels as if you have to spend, and this was within 15-30mins into the game. Gg. Went from super easy and fun into impossible."
The last update it's kinda cringe. You can't buy knights with gems anymore as far as I know and the rewards of begginer's daily quest changed for some reason
overall good but i still can't watch add for more reward
Fun and good customer service
"Still 1 star for me, im already level 20 and i can't get the beginners daily quest reward ssr lea because some of the level up quest bug (day 6 reach level 18) and i only have 1 day to finish it lol! the new daily challenge is useless and wasted run because the bosses and skills (x2) are TOO HUGE and so pixelated!!!"
Cool game
Unfortunately the game became unplayable its asking me to update but theirs no update in the app store
does not load
"The game is fun, but I have been stuck at the loading screen while it says loading complete for some time."
"Good potential (due to the genre), there are some good ideas, but overall it really isnt that great : i've completed the game in 3 days without paying, all levels are the same, a few skills are OP so you either get them or lose. RNG isnt well compensated, and it is frustrating to never reach the point where all skills and artifacts are max lvl."
Carbon copy of survivor io with a worse pay to win model...
"Hello there,please make experience orb drop more blue/gold.i know this game wanna follow other successful .io game but at least make EXP BOOST skill(passive).so for now,3star for yaüëå"
Another reskin
This game is ok I guess adds a buddy system where you can take other heros with you into battle but the problem with this is they are in a straight line behind the hero offering very little to no support at all they should surround the main hero so all angles are covered the first level was super hard took many times to pass it and now I'm stuck at level 10 so idk if it's worth playing or not at this point higher tier heros needs gems to get them and gear also require gems.....
I love this game please add more updata:)
"Basically, EXACTLY Survivor.io just with different characters."
Can even play
"A little generic but not bad, excellent music tho"
"One of the better-looking reverse bullet hells, but that's a detriment. In looking good, there's so much visual noise that it makes it difficult to see what's happening. There needs more refinement, for example: wiping out enemies with a bomb, there's no moment of reprieve, they spawn right away. Movement is on crack, you will run into by accident. This game should be labeled in development."
"I would like to give you 5 star, but after I completed chapter 1 ( I completed 5 min to 15 min directly ) game doesn't go back to home screen and pause button doesn't work after I forcefully exit the game and came back but it showing me that I didn't completed chapter 1. If cannot even complete chapter how I'm suppose to play your game."
Awesome game until you finally unlock ad removal just to find out that it's $10 a month.
Best gameplay but minor bug getting worst evrytine log in
Very fun but needs more content!
"Sadly another survivor with bad twist. Reply: Ok dev, i'll wait."
Good but littered with bugs like Code 0: Operation Time out at 11.30 mark
üòé üÜíÔ∏è üòé üÜíÔ∏è üòé.
2 stars. Why? Pros 1) Simple gameplay 2) Good to kill time 3) Try our different combo to dish out attacks. Cons 1) The maps are limited. Get bored easily. 2) Repetitive gameplay. Get bored easily. 3) No dificult boss 4) Devs are stingy in giving out gems. Not much freebies. 5) Summon rates for equipment are lousy.
"at some wave, enemy spawn are really slow and rare, 3 bosses with 1-2 miniboss for 15mins seriously make it boring to pass, cant even going past more than lv 25 every stage"
"Love this game overall_gameplay etc, specially one of these trendy Hordes/Rogue like games at the moment , but the only issue(personal) that I have it that the characteristics /designs/fonts are too small for my eyes..."
Boring
"Well, 3 for now..what level we need to unlock event and other stuffs?..since i unlocked 7 days quests, there still 1 locked feature... and im just cleared stage 7.."
"Good game. I love it. But when in battle I need more exp because it too hard to evolve skill, just 2 skill can evolved but we have 6!!!. And reduce play time to 10min pls ,15min too long for one time. Pls fix it"
"Pretty alright. I have had no problems so far, other than somewhere near 9 minutes in you get stormed by 100s of enemies that give moderate lag... I hope there is a way to defeat a horde like that. Otherwise, I'm looking forward for more updates and will stick around longer ;)"
Im almost done with the game and still havent unlocked daily events is it glitched or just a placeholder and if so why is it necessary for daily and weekly quests
Can link account with facebook or google backup save game or transfer account to other phone ?
"Powerups seem weak and ineffective. When you say meteor shower, I don't expect a pebble every once in a while."
Doesn't load no matter what I do. Something else is wrong for you to check out please. A review and rating will be done then.
It won't install
Excellent
Niceeeeeeee
