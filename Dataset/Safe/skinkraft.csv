Good product and very useful
"I haven't received my products I prepaid for from skinkraft and yet it shows delivered. I tried reaching out but customer support of skinkraft is worst. There is no way you can connect to them about issues. Even in an open chat they seem to ignore what you write and they just say it's delivered. Even in the bluedart it says received by kdkdkfks something like that. I haven't received it, how can it be delivered. Either refund my money or deliver my products."
Skinkraft is best ‚ô•Ô∏èbest experience
Option cursors not working
Very worst app I got pimples on my face
Good
"I just loved you're products its good But I'm tired of your feedback calls goddamn!!!! I told those guys a hundred thousand time to stop calling me n put my number in DND, i blocked a dozen number already, i kinda started hating this brand just bcs of ur irritating feedback calls, üò°"
I like this product very much ü•∞
Worst application as I have ordered my money was deducted but order placed is not showing tried to connect but not getting any way to connect only getting auto generated message that ticket raised and automatically it's closed also without resolving my issue
Company has been calling me to give review on product.i have asked them not to call me.please delete my account.i no longer want you guys. You have been sending me watsapp and even call me everyday. Thanks.
"Worst experience with the app as well as Skincraft. App is for namesake. They do not assist their customers anyway. After raising tickets they don't call,after cancelling order soon after placing it they don't refund and after receiving products customers don't get all the products ordered!"
I had use their products which is really absolutely Worst they are liars since I'm using their products now I'm facing extremely bad hairfall which I had never have been faced in my life. l request to everyone don't trust them They fooling the people I know their reality Thank you
"Very bad experience with the products. My skin ruined with the products. So much red pimples on my cheeks. Instead having complaint the customer cares told to not to use serum for some days but no results come out. My dark spots didn't faded. My skin feels dry. And the end, I want the money back as soon as possible. I don't need your ""sorry for inconvenience"" or anything. I want my money back."
Worst product didn't work
Worst bcz 3 months expired product given
-2--~√ó3#24@3
Too good
I have been waiting for my order from more than 10 days . Skin care customised product . still haven't received any updates on that . Worst service ever and never going to suggest anyone. No proper response from customer service
jab mujhe order mila toh usme product ko kese use ksrna h h toh likha hi nhi h maine pehle bhi jab mere pass inka call aaya tab bhi maine inko yeh hi feedback diya tha lekin fir vo hi kiya koi use direction nhi h
Like it üòÄ
Product excellent! Too much delay in delivery prolonged one dissatisfied I can't use other shampoos they won't deliver.
Why no one picks up the call. Why no one calls back? Worst costumer care executive service.
"Hello team, I am not able to buy skincare products in this application. So please let me know what is the issue."
Yesterday I only I received my products so dont know about the results but they don't keep the customer or app undated. They should update like your product is on the way or it's been shipped. They update all that after its deliveryüôÉ
Wowwwww being an old customer recieved the product damaged never expected... Thanks for making me understand that now name is gained so no value for customer's
Guys don't take blue box membership because it offers 20 percent on first order only they don't apply 20 percent on your next order please guys be attentive.
Waste of money worst product leaves so many acne on my face
Worst aap the customer support they don't even respond and my money stuck in the aap and they and not responding.
Awesome products
The customer support service is worst. You keep on complaining but there is no response at all. One bot is there who just replies and will never connect you to any customer executive. I have raised single issue n number of times but still haven't received a single call from there customer care department. Worst customer service.
Your customer support is useless worth less you idiots have no proper customer support
"Hello Team, In latest updated version, we are unable to postpone order as it is showing invalid date format. Also, there is no additional option to enter other than number/digit. Kindly check"
When I see this product add on Instagram I think this is amazing product. I ordered this product but after using skinkraft results are not very good it's just okay for me. I am not very happy because my skin problems as its. I am using this product last 2 months.
"I am not satisfied with the customized hair shampoo and conditioner. After using it, my scalp is very itchy (which was not before use of SkinKraft) and even after taking follow ups, the app keeps on telling same thing which is use less shampoo and more conditioner. It's not at all helpful. After having this discussed with SkinKraft team, they are saying consult Dermatologist for the problem which has been caused by their product. I'll not recommend this at all."
Waste of money
Worst delivery service I ordered my product on 8th May and still not delivered
No customer support
Currently using the 5 step regime but not getting results as said and my acne increased oil secretion also increased.If this is customized then I am happily using non customized productsüòëüòë Huge Disappointment
I bought products from it and the products is worst üëé I use products from last 1 month the products is very waste don't buy it
"Not satisfied with products recommended for my hair. I am sharing my review after one month of using the recommended products. My three hair problems were hairfall, dandruff and less volume oily hair. Out of these, only dandruff issues seem to be reduced by 20-30% whereas i am still facing other hair problems everyday."
Worst experience ever. I order the 5 steps package along with the payment but now they say I haven't placed my order. While contacting the customer service there AI Stuti just says that ticket has been raised and we will be back with 24-48 hours and till date I haven't received any call or email from them. It's been 3 days post that Stuti thing.
Skincraft products are good but bad customer service. This time I ordered 4th times. Fir different problem. I was going to receive 5 product but I received 4 only. Also totally different from as I mentioned. I am trying a lot to customer support but no one is responding.
Products are nice
"This app order itselfs and I'm getting unnecessary sms of order being dispatched or order placed, i have reaching all the numbers given on the site and WhatsApp but nothing is working even their employees not recieving my calls on the working days. If i got any order at my door I'll not pay as i haven't order anything. KINDLY CHECK THIS ISSUE ON NOT ORDERING ANY PRODUCT BUT GETTING SMS OF BEING ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED. KINDLY CREATE A PHONE CALL WHERE CUSTOMER CAN DISCUSS DIRECTLY . THANKS"
"I don't get my order, already 7 days done to this process bt not my problem solved"
It was totally working and great for me
"Horrible experience after using 1 month of using products..i have order this product because of my dry skin and spot, but it give me pimple, i never have pimple before that, But after using this product I got pimple, skin become more dry, even skin coming off because of dryness.. And Whenever I use serum for spot correction it's given burning like sensation... My skin is not so sensitive it's suits almost everything, but Skinkraft is the first thing which give me so bad experience.. Never buy"
Love these products Very much satisfied Thanku skin craft

Mundhu vadi chuudandi tervate nammandi...
I have been using this product last 8 months.its work very well on the face and it gives very good glow on the face But my problem is that this product is not available on any platform like flipkart amozon myntra except skincraft only.I just want to say that this product should be available everywhere. Thanks üòä
I have first ordered damage repair shampoo and conditioner which worked really well for me atleast better than chemical loaded shampoos. Also tried thier face serum which is also good. It's been more than a year now since I started using skinkraft. Can improve more but still satisfied. Should improve their app structure and access to customer care
"I have genuinely felt a great difference in my skin in max 3 weeks. The pores have reduced effectively which I had never thought would, since I have tried various products. Also my skin texture has become smooth and there is a different glow on my skin. It has been more than 6 weeks I have started using it and would suggest everyone to try this. Worth spending money on the products. Skinkraft is the best."
Nais product
"All the products are very good, especially the Brightside facial serum is very effective."
"I came to know about skinkraft from one of my friend, i started using custom products from past few months. I am Really happy with the products and recommend all to use them. As these are customized products which suits our hair and skin needs."
One of the best customized app for skincare
The recommended as per the skin type and concern are really good and this regimen helping me in my skin concerns. Satisfied with the products and the results üòÄ
"I did not like these products, it did not have any effect, on the contrary, face issues started happening. ........ üëé worst products ever üò°üò°üò°üëé"
Been using this app for a while for customised hair and skin products. It's easy to use and help you find the best products that suit your hair and skin. Highly recommended.
SkinKraft has made it easy for me to choose products that suit my hair and skin needs. The easily navigable app has made life so much easier! Cheers!
Worst after sale service. Not able to get in touch with customer care since last month order. Product received was having bad smell and very less quantity.
I want refund for my products which i ordered on 12 th march and today's is 2 April ... 30 din abhi pure nhi hue hai products use kre hue so i can get my money back please help me ...i chat with stuti but according to her 30 din se  jyada uo gye hai kon si maths hai ye aaplog ki please return my money back fake product hai meri skin or khrab ho gyi hai
"This app is not working properly lately, only on placing our 1st order it was working fine, now it doesn't update any delivery of products and doesn't let me change the product which is not suitable for my skin"
Order skinkraft se kiye to price 699 tha delivery vala 999 price bole to isme same price kyu nhi bataya gya
This is the wrost product.even they are not connecting with you. I will never buy again this product.very bed expirence.
Products are good but I can't get free product with my kit
Its a product worth giving a try.. Its customized for your individual skin needs and so simple to place an order on the app
Disgusting
"Customised for me, I prefer the skin products more"
Good products but pls deliver in 24 hrs I got after 2 days
"I really don't know how to choose products that suits me best. Till now the way I purchased a product was by selecting a random product and used that. Later I came to know there is a customization products that suits my skin type. I started using Skinkraft products, now I really happy with these products. While placing order I had many doubts regarding the product and how it works, but the support team was cleared all my doubts instantly. Thank you Skinkraft for giving me best. ü§©"
Great!!
I started my skincare routine with these products and i am so glad that I made this choice. I am happy with the personalized skincare regimen that SkinKraft offers by customizing products according to my concerns and skintype.
I absolutely love this app. It really changed my Skincare game. The app's skin analysis is very accurate and helped me understand my skin. it is very easy to use and I would highly recommend everyone to give it a try.
"As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate the attention to detail that skinkraft provides. The app takes into account my skin's unique needs and recommends gentle, effective products."
Mind blowing
399 membership charge not refund Contact number not pickup
This aap is just disgusting.... I have to cancel my order but this doesn't let you cancel the product even the number are useless and they doesn't even reply to the mail üì¨.... Just bad product and disgusting aap....
Products are not safe for skin.
"Very bad experience, no customer service available try twice a week but didn't get any reply."
Useless and pathetic is the word i have for you guys. A complete scam to be precise.
"This application is disgusting, not getting any help from the application, no customer service, there is a chat process in which we do not get any help, and from last 3 days my order is showing in transit, and now they are messaging Hi there! We've noticed that you left without confirming your order. This is really disgusting, poor service."
"Excellent Product and amazing results I am using customized skin regimen past 2 months. Now I can see my skin glowing and very soft. Many features available- different plans, freebies, offers, anytime cancellation and customer care available for any info/issues. üíùThank you SkinKraft for suggesting me products to keep my skin healthy and glowingüíù"
Poor and worst experience. I ordered 3face cleansers they charged rs 999 and shipped only 1. After even 10 days of complaint no executive called me for resolution
"I have been using Skinkraft for several months now, and I must say I'm extremely happy with the results. The personalized skincare regimen that Skinkraft provides is unlike any other I've tried before. I love that the products are customized to my skin type and concerns, and I can see a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin."
Have been a Skinkraft Skincare products user for a while and seen amazing results!
"I am a SkinKraft customer from a very long time. Have tried multiple products in the past, but these have worked the best for me. It was also really easy to place my order on this app. Highly recommend!"
The products are pretty good so far. I like the way they are customized and set as a regimen routine with clear instructions of usage for multiple skin types. Well cared about the customer feedback by taking the followup and changing the products for no cost if the regimen products don't suit. I have a good experience with Skinkraft. Keep Up!
"I recently started using this skin care app and I have to say, I'm really impressed. I love the personalized recommendations based on my skin type and concerns. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to up their skin care game!"
Awesome customized product for my skin Thus app is very useful Thankyou skinkraft ü•∞
Hello team My order no is #4538622 I returned products at the time of purchase but it was not cancelled.later on customer care representative told to refuse and I will get refund.But still no refund initiated to my account Kindly work on it. Thanks
Great products and very convenient app. Its easy to use and made placing orders really convenient. The in-app help is great in case there any confusion about your orders.
Worthy products and valuable!
"Placed my order from this app recently. I really like skinkraft products so I was happy to find the app. In my experience, it was easy to use and trustworthy."
"Sab kuch fake hai mene isko use kiya to mera face black or pimples aa gaye bahut dukha hua mujhe ye sb dekha kr mera face kharab kar diya pura,"
Very bad experience. I used the product for 1 week and immediately got rashes all over my face with itching. When I tried for refund and complaint the customer care didn't even respond me . DON'T USE SKINKRAFT.
"This product is very bad. before my skin is so good condition but after using this product my skin is damaged and burn,red pathches is on my skin, very bad experience,waste of money."
"Fraud.. Don't trust skinkarft.. Please don't buy products from skinkarft bcoz there is no service if product will delivery at your door step, I order skin care kit of 1560rs n there is missing items as well n empty bottle.. When I cancel my further hair care order worth 800rs than there is no refund.. I try to call them many times.. I email 5 times n did chat several times but now response.. Don't trust them.. Its scam only.."
I had purchased the hair shampoo and conditioner my experience is the world's worst experience with this product product which I had used which is skinkraft product and I feel I wasted my money to buy this product
The worst brand ever they don't have any help line number neither they are communicating
My orders are getting cancelled by itself the next day...they cancelled my products four times already......
This product is very bad.my Skin is so good condition but after using this product my skin is damaged and so many pimple come. Very bad experience. I am just regret to order this product 1600 rupes is wast.very bad
Product missing
I am using this product but they didn't send me to my address correctly this is my worst experience for this product i m so sad that I didn't receive to my addresse
Purchased hair care products and they wrote that fave serum is free but not received in box... Also chat with customer care executive but thare is no option to write our issue..
"No wonder the rating you got. How do you even run the business with this app, useless and uninstalled. Please no scripted/robotic reply on my comment."
Unable to add multiple products. They just have buy now option and not the option to add to cart. Really hard to navigate. You get 3 products for 999 but you cannot add more than one to cart
Awesome customized skincare products for my skintype
"I cancelled my order... But , i didn't received refund yet... What is this... So many times complained.... Still didn't receive.... Almost 20 days over.... Rs. 1599/- still didn't receive.... Seriously... I never ever seen service like this..."
Worst app üòàüòà
"This app is just useless ,I even can't type my name after I choosed my age"
üëé for App
Can take the skin analysis
Cant even write the name also worst experience
The page doesn't load at all. I dont know what happened but at first the app was working properly but then i can't even take the follow-up of my regimen or edit my order or open the page for it.
Don't use this very horrible
I am not able to create a profile name
Always showing error when trying for order . Worst app. But product is good . You can see result feom 1st day
I'm trying to place my order but app is not responding and not showing any products plus not let me check my sink type
"very bad experience for me.....i need assistance for my skin type but after putting my age, their is no option for giving name or tapping on name.....why you guys are not updating this. I use to try for last 1 weeks ...but...again and again it's shows same error.....after this i can't believe this all insta review are genuine or fake."
Do not use this app i can't even enter my name or place any orders it's one of the worst apps I've ever used
"I have acne scars, acne marks with open pores and this Skin Kraft product doesn't effect as on these issues on my face.. And also when I again want to describe my skin problem then this doesn't show any option otherthan ""dry skin or oily skin"". I AM TOTALLY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT"
The app is not functioning
Useless app.. very disappointed
App doesn't works. It's not even allowing me to sign up
"Unable to order, App is very slow & very poor performance.. SkinKraft should concentrate on resolving issues in website & mobile app to retain existing customers and as well as to attract new."
Why this app is not running from what is your name..there is a problem please check it
Good
I've been trying to place an order by making my skin profile but that's just not happening. I enter my age and then the name option comes and I'm unable to type my name which is why am unable to go further with my order and on contacting you guys with the same problem I have received no assistance. It's very disappointing and unprofessional that you guys do not help your customer which is why I don't think I will be using this app anymore because it has terrible customer care.
"I just downloaded the app and not even able to complete ""know your skin"" process. It's not giving me the option to type my name only. Worst service ever experienced"
Poducts toh Thik he but delivery karne Mai 1 mahina Laga diya
Nice product‚ù§Ô∏è
"The app is very confusing and not friendly. It has a lot of functional loopholes. I am facing trouble in confirming the next order. To be specific, the confirm renewal page doesn't works well. It has some bug due to which the details are not getting displayed. Please resolve that."
This app is not showing any response i am trying this for the first time what is this I can't even write my name it is not responding.... Very disappointed
The initial option to enter the name is not working even trying multiple times installing the app. I cannot proceed further with any of the options.. So literally we cannot use the app for what it's created for.. Please fix the bugs
"Very bad customer service, I received broken conditioner bottle, I raised complaint against this but didn't get any response from slinkraft, bad experience with this app they don't even have proper customer Care number I tried so many times.. If ur responding plz solve my issues my order number is #4372846"
Such a bad app... Pls work on it.... No search option available.... I wanted to search Age Amend Serum.... But..... No search option..... Worse app ever used...
"Worst, like I can't type my name and it's not allowing me to go further.üëéüèª"
"Very useless products first 2 months worked well after that my face It got worse, it got worse, it got worse, it got worse, it got worse, it got worse, it got worse."
"Its the worst decision to trust Skinkraft. I placed order on Dec 27, 2022 and it has yet not arrived and customer service is lying continuously. For the first time made pre-paid order and you stole it. Its a fair warning to everyone. Never make a pre-paid order or else be ready to get robbed by SKINKRAFT. Customer Service doesn't even respond and is not at all ready to refund my Rs. 1000. I want my refund. just refund my money."
"Firstly this App is useless. You can't get any help through this app. To top it all they have no customer service available. Toll-free number given never leads you to anyone. Emails are never responded. And product, well it's personal experience, I myself have very had experience with it and I am trying to cancel my subscription but guess what, there app doesn't let you do it, and the number provided never gets connected. This product and it's customer service is a big joke."
Please don't use this useless app. They are frauds.
Worst products dont ever try.. biggest mistake was buying the products
Effective products awesome
The worst product i have ever used i lost lots of money using this product cheat please don't buy this product üôÑüôÑüôÑ
"I have ordered skinkraft hair routine and already paid 999 for that , and i have not received products but you people have marked it delivered, such a pathetic service from your side , no calls from delivery partner and from you people also First experience is worst , i will never recommend anybody for your products Please refund my money"
Afeerah 7ü•∞
Very worst shampoo..m depressed and cant return the product and my money backüò•üò•üò•
Products are hood but as far as you have any problem regarding Nything they take years to solve. Ridiculous customer support. Just keep on emailing and their 48hrs never comes.
The app is working. I have been trying to take follow up but it's not responding..I also want to unsubscribe the plan that I have but it's also not happening..
"Pathetic services. I made the payment on 28th Dec paymentreceived but no order placed, still waiting for refund. Contacted customer care twice. Same answers to wait for 2-4 business days. No resolution. Will not continue now"
It's really good......it's just amazing üëè
This app is not working properly I waiting for my product at least 25 days but they say me our products is on the way I am very disappointed about this schedule.i hope you guys are something doing for it.
It is not working at all. I just want to cancel my order and their options to cancel.

I don't know what to do. I can't Track my order. And the most important thing for last 10 days no one there to resolve my problem.

If you this products no one saves you go mee chavu meru chavandi
I'm not able to excess my keyboard on this app
"It's seems like a fraud aap,on my first ordered they delivered the product on time which I had paid a payment of RS 1199/- but later on (follow up) they charges the amount of Rs799/- (on 20/11/22) but they doesn't sent the product yet.There service is not good, really disappointed."
Pathetic!There is no proper coustomer care services.there is a virtual assistant she told us that coustomer care will call within 48 hours but there is na call back from their side. Even i emailed them but from there also no response. I tried to contact with skinkraft since a long time but their services are so poor and pathetic. Highly disappointing
"Skinkraft is offering serum free with the products but I've not received any, trying to reach through chat, also sent mail but not getting any response from Skinkraft. Very disappointed. Don't know products are genuine or not,ü§î"
I'm really disappointed as this is tha fsr tym order something from skinkraft and i received with missing products broken bottle caps and also bottle were half empty I think used product very bed na hi koi cl ka option h na koi MSG plz request koi mt lo lye log pgl bnaye h Khali bottle bej kr 1000 kha gye chor h ye @skinKraft

I have very bad experience with your products ....it made my skin more darker nd bad .....i bought your products to make my skin brighter nd fair but üòëüòîüëé......i have bad experience with skinkraft ...u didnt give any instruction to use the products ...you should insert instructions in box ...üëé
I haven't received my refund yet. I sent alot of email but nothing happened
"Worst app ever..i have ordered Contumised product after filling questioner provided by the application, but there is no msg or mail that my order has been placed..but money has been deducted after providing address or personal details.. App login id of mine not showing history or order placed.. So now from where i get to know about my order ,or money."
Worst customer service.... I was delivered wrong product when from past one week I'm trying to reach them... The only response which i get is your ticket is being raised executive shall contact in 48hrs...worst experience and pathetic level zero customer service.
Got spilled product in the packet my all shampoo and conditioner are spilled and I m trying to replace but skinkraft customer care is very bad and very slow my product is not replace yet very horrible customer care support I m uninstalling the app and never buy anything from skinkraft
App is not working and it's too slow and very frustrating and My order area is not working at all. I am very unsatisfied with Android app of skinkraft.
Seemed open Product received and the app is not installing as well... I don't recommended this skincraft ..
Woow so much nice
I am using hair products and after my 1st use i really feel happy....Thank you skinkraft‚ù§Ô∏è
Why delivery me used product? All the cream were out from the container..I'm not happy with the service... Spending more than 1k with used product. Useless!!!!!
I ordered the your 4 product 1. Synder face cleanser for women SK2187FC 2. Barrier repair moisturizing gel for women SK2193MO 3. Daily Reparative facial serum SK2142DFS 4. Hyaluronic acid moisture serum SK2107HFS My complaint : 2nd on Barrier repair moisturizing gel for women container bottle Only half quantity of the cream is contained in the bottle remaining quantity is missing... Full bottle not filled why ? I'm very sad
I don't understand why they even ask for a follow up when they just don't bother to get in touch with the customer. Moreover I needed a shampoo for hairfall and they sent me daily shine and volume. Worst customer service
"My follow up is due but the application is not functioning properly, so it showing loading only.. Please do check and do further needful."
This product is not good for me so Stop calling.... fate up
"Upgrade your customer care service department. Just selling the product and job done?! No! Products are costly, you people take questions.. U follow that or just fake? Improve Customer service."
So far so good but until it comes to some items in the order is missing and when tried to contact customer care no response n not at all helpfull .. i paid for 2 items but when i open the package only 1 item recieved.. i raise a request and also chat with stuti but it is not at all helpful .. so my money jus got wasted because only 1 item and the other never recieved back again.. very disappointed with how they deal with customers issue .. it just m losing my calm and patience now..
Nice product
This is really a disappointment for me.. I ordered a hair care shampoo conditioner and serum but I received an incomplete package.. the serum was missing I was trying to share a mail I also tried to call the CX support but there was no revert from there end. This is such a waste of money. I am not at all satisfied
Unable to change the date of my product I want to prepone my product but I am unable to do it. I want my deducted amount to be refunded but unable to get it. No customer care number chat support is useless. My amount is still with them and unable ro get it back still fighting for 1000rs.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°
I've made a payment but my order has been not placed how will I get refund kindly reply
"Very bad service, i never see this type of fraud, i mad my payment 799 rs. on 8 th October, still now i haven't receive the order. If are you not good for delivery please back my money. I raised lot of tickets, but no use. Please back my money.i will not move with you further"
The app is not working properly even i thought at first this would be an issue from my end but no its not. Also there is no more flexibility to explore the products or speak with any dermatologist through the app. The skin care products are also very limited with no consultancy ...products are good but there has to be a consultancy via app if you have to advertise so much and get long lasting customers
I can't place order because I can't write my address in this app no keyboard shows. Very disgusting app
Customer service is very poor i didn't received my products yet
Solved my problem regarding to app. Thanks
Delivery thing is very poor I am ordering the products from last 2 weeks kindly either make them available on other apps or improve the delivery
Good product
"This app as well as customer service is so bad as i ordered a skin care regkmen and it didn't work well then they renewed it after 30 days and said to em that the renewed will be free of cost and when I'm trying to talk to them on chat as it's the only option there, I have no option to reply."
Your costumer service is very poor. You never call. I have a paid for my parcel which I ordered on October 8th but I've not received yet. But it shows that it is already delivered to me. My money is wasted now. And I cannot even get in touch with your helpdesk.
Awesome it cure myfaca tshape area's problem.
Very Very Very Bad I am trying to contact them from last 4 days. As rupees is deducted from my account but I haven't received any message or anything regarding the product It is 5th day today from the order placement
"Not good: I am unable to place the order again, app is also not working neither Google link"
Worst product wasted my money got more pimple and my skin turned very dark don't buy at all cheaters
Wastege of money ü•±
App doesn't work at all...and their customers service is horrible.. products are good...but you won't get any kind of assistance in case you have some queries about something. I had raised concern about missing product but I didn't get any response from the customer service till now..
The customer care do not answer the calls and do not respond. I have created so many tickets to get my concern resolved but I have not received any response from last 10 days.
*WASTE OF MONEY* got only 3 boxes even after paying for 5 boxes in advance. *Fraudsters* *I paid in advance for 5 boxes got only three and stopped receiving products after that.* Customer care support worst. And products are even worse. My face is full of acne. Requested so many times for CS call no response. My money is gone and my skin has worsened!
Useless products....harmful for skin
"Choosing skinkraft was the worst decision I guess . I enrolled for a subscription believing that the products might work . Now that after 1-2 months I'm not happy with the results and want to cancel my subscription/order no one is responding . Wow the customer service is so so bad that it irritates people sometimes. The support email and customer care number mentioned in the app isn't working at all . Now can you give me the solution ,?????????????"
It is so good app.my all acne were gone within a week thank you skincraft
"I had recieved empty bottles after that i have complain thrice but no response m getting, worst customer care service"
Can't see my order...in this app.
"I ordered a product from them and didn't suited me, so I applied for refund. They says keep using whether skin gets worsened! Pathetic service. Never buy from this."
"I paid amount but ther was no confirmation sms,,and mail.and no one is responding my queries,,,and I cont do a refund process all so..."
Third class customer support plz don't order this website customer support is very poor always problem connect with customer executive... So disappointed
Not useful at all ..totally waste of money
Horrible
Worst product my skin has damage
Poor customer support. I am trying hard to contact them but the customer care service sucks
"Customer service is trash, they ignore for days like hell i have to write negative on social media after every purchase to get help from them. It's been 15 days i am chasing them on email just to get simple help regarding products but they ignore. They are garbage as company. I would suggest to go for Cure skin or some other brands where Customers are treated well."
I want to cancel but not accept worst appüò†
i have been using the hair product since 2 weeks and my hairfall is at its peak and there is literally no hair growth at all. i am loosing my hair from root . after 1 week i thought hair fall will be curbed but there is no difference at all . infact i think i have wasted my money and above all i have took a step to damage my hair to next level by choosing this item . They do not even give proper response. Don't buy from this site.
Worst experience I got with Skin craft Hair fall increased then previous
I accidentally make double payment on my first order.will u pay back? And your custmor care number is not working then where should i go for complaint?
Very nice
Cannot edit products. Can't take follow up on the app.
Worst experience with skin craft products... i had a problem regarding my skin and i started using skin craft product recomended by them... after using for 4- 5 days my skin became red and black... and even i started having irritation and ichyness on my face .. so i recomend not to use these products...
"Service are use less. Coustomer care number provided in the app is invalid, They don't even reply on your query mails.. Most Third class service is being provided by Skinkraft."
"You guys are pathetic, it's been a month I've ordered my product and multiples times i requested the callback. Neither you have given the callback nor my refund and worst of all you are not even delivering my products. It's the worst behaviours i could expect from any brand. I used to recommend the products to people but now i feel even i have to stop using them. Kindly respond and process my refund."
Using hair products from skinkraft was not a wise decision . I think i wasted my money on these products. hair problems are still same .üò¥ I wish i could have checked real reviews of these products rather than believing in advertisements. Kindly don't misguide the public through these ads. Plus customer service is not too good.
I have used the products. Some of them didn't work on me. They assure their customers that if a product doesn't suit they send a new one or solve the issue. Even after giving my report thrice (They give otion of call back) neither I got any call nor any solution. They just know how to sell.
There customer caller calls 200 times in a day ... it sometimes feels like I stole their property documents as well as 2 kidneys
Order didn't deliver. This is worst app
The most Ghatia product I have ever bought.... my face was fine in terms of pimples.... after using this I can't say how many pimples are there on my face..... Issey use krke kuch thik ho na ho but pure face me pimples jarur aajte h..... hated..!!
bhut hi bekar product hai dont buy this..... pure face me pimple aane lagta h
"Its not showing products ,nor the app is working it just shows that cunning circle and app doesnt work only its the 3rd time i downloaded it ,,what the f##küò°"
"Can't checkout, the keyword is not available"
I don't understand why there is no free gifts in 1st order in skinkraft apps while there is free gift from other sites ü•¥
What a sence of humour üò°???? They want that i use their product 4-5 months. Product lagane se fayada ho ya nhi. How cleaver!!!! Jaise hi app dubara rating update karenge ya fir new comment add karenge old comment delete ho jayega.
"Product are nice but customer care services are worse. I did order yesterday. Payment is done successfully but order is not confirmed,also I didn't get my order number. I call the customer care and also send email. There is no response. This is happened with me second time and also happen when I pay online. I didn't expect"
Only problem this app very slow process product was very late delivery. There is no solving problems from coustomer
Very bed shampoo and conditioner
Many good a skin and Hair a care of craft
"The review is not about app but it's all about the products which I am using of hair product nd skin products both are worse than I expected even my skin get more pimples than before. After charging so much price, it's pretty expensive, but still it doesn't suits me. Even though I cannot give follow up of my skin improvement, why it's only follow up available about products? You should mention to give review about skin as well whether it's improved any results or not. I am very disappointed."
Review about the product. Worst product doesn't work out. Products are not effective. Just waste of money. It even more damages the skin. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS. .
"Not for products ,for technical issue or service"
"Products are good but customer services are very poor, I am trying to reach them since last 6 days via email and call but no response. They delivered wrong products to me now I am unable to return them as in app i don't see any option to return and no one contacting me from Skincraft to resolve my issue."
The product is very nice... But this app is not working properly... I have been trying to change my product since 4-5 days ...
"Hello Sir/ Madam With utmost respect, but strong disappointment, I am drawing your attention towards a SERIOUS concern. 1) While checking the products, your website does not allow to showcase it's full description. ( Un-Integrated website) 2) SkinKraft does not have a proper customer support, where concerns can be raised appropriately. ( Robotic responses by the Bot ""Stuti"") 3) I tried your Toll free number which never gives any option to reach a Customer service representative"
I'm unable to create a hair profile tried it for like a 100 times
"We took subscription of rs 2997 for hair products on 10 april,but didn't recieved a single product.and also skin craft is not responding. Now lost trust and will file complaint ."
I will uesd 4 month no result good üëéüëéüëéüëé
I want to cancel my subscription . No response on the same
"My face just got damage what had happened to this products. It was ‚Äò‚Äòacne exfoliate facial cream‚Äô . It is written that it doesn't keep dark spots and fight with it. But what the hell has happened to me now . My face is full of dark spots, acne, open poresüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Why????????? My life was full of stress just because i have acne."
I used this product for 3 months and my face becomes very dull and full of ance
Why can't I cancel my order after I placed it ? Worse app ever .. No customer satisfaction...
"Worst experience ever .... I ordered product from skinkraft without giving me any reason they cancelled my order and as i did online payment, I mailed them to refund my money but their is no response from them . Really disappointed from this"
0/100
Such a por experience just damaged my hair totally I had to cosult the doctor he said it gonna turn into white soon what u jave done with you rhair it's soo damaged skin karft product are he'll I asdive other please don't waste your money it just don't waste of money it's a waste of your hair and skin to rather than this consult any homeophathy doctor
Best skincare products compared to other expensive products. Pls give it a try .
"After trying here and there for now for more than two weeks,i am fed up and writing this here.Your customer support is really very bad it's impossible to reach you and that's why i wasn't able to place my order.You don't reply mails,u don't call back,toll free is busy always.I was loving the product but can't renew it coz of your lame customer support which is the must have for customers as well as for producers."
Products are good but pathetic customer care service after sales...
This customized skin product package caused allergy on my face. I think that they have invested themselves more on marketing part but not on the actual product. I am not happy. It's a wastage of my money. Can I get a refund??
"Very bad service. Aap is not working. Customer service is very bad nobody is replies, they are not receiving calls. I got very experienced from skinkraft"
"it's just like waste of money is what I feel, i was having little little pimples and darkspots so by seeing insta adds I ordered but it's been more than 3 Weeks that am using these products not even a single change I could notice and my skin become worse than before getting lot of pimples damn I didn't expected this."
Hnji
The worst skin product it makes your skin tone darker and your face looks dull after use.. Worst one.. Really money waste totally wastage of money please don't buy
The product is good but the ux ui is bad. There is no option to cancel the product. Keyterms for renewal are confusing the msg renewal sounds like clickbate.48 hrs is too long. Do you understand what 48 hrs wait means.Imagine you placed an order by mistake. You can't cancel it. So you go to customer support.Wait 48hrs. Delivery will happen before the response.One can't send the delivery boy without paying. You would return the product.Guess what couldn't find that one as well. Then +48hrs.
"This app and the products are yotally fake worst waste of money I want my money back, I advice not to purchase these items entirely waste and worst"

West of money. When I use this product next day my face fully reacted and face full acne comes. Costumer service not avalaibale for this product.
"App is not at all good. I ordered product on 18th may order was successfully created , money is deducted but app does not show the order. Next day they cancel it, without refunding money. There is no tracking of this thing. Every page take time at loading.please stop playing with customer money"
nice
The products are really nice but the customer service is really sucks actually they don't even care about their customers I don't know why . If u face problem with something other then cancellation and how to product use u can't find answer bcz there is no response from their side . I also ended up cancelling my subscription but the haircare and skin care boht suits me well
Never buy this product it'll give u more acne waste of money. I used for 1 week n this product gave me +5 acne instead
It's products are just amazingüòçü§©üëç
"Worst customer service. I sent the images to ur support mail if and sent images to whatsApp, but no response, I've been trying to reach u ppl from a week. Is this how u take care of ur customer?? I received broken producta and on top of that no response or care from u guys. Pls ppl don't purchase skinkraft products. Worst ever."
I have order it and I don't why is it taking so much time please come fast I am in urgent need. My face is worsening so much. #3466209 Edit - seriously bro ! I have ordered on 10 may and by today its 18 may . How the hell on earth is this ? How many days will I wait for this ? I fell like i should cancel it . This just irritates me.
"Very bad aap ,ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ i hate this"
I have never seen such pathetic service. I cancelled my order they returned the money but the amount I paid was ‚Çπ1199 and the amount i got back was ‚Çπ799.
Use kro tb tk hi acne thik rhte h bad m vaps ho jateeee h
How yo reorder the same product in this app. It doesn't have that option pls make it sure
There is no mention how to use the product for the first time users....
No result My primary concern is black spots ..I'm using products from 20days my black spots doesn't fade away little also and extra benefit is iam getting more pus pimples daily...and follow up for this products doesnts open even I'm spending time more than 30mins ...it doesn't open..i requested to all to not to buy any product from this skinkraft.....all are getting same products only
They not provide delivery boy calling number lots of problems getting to receiving it order very bad service
Worst service None of Customer executives contact me
"This app is not working as the way it show in the advertisement...it had been two months , I am using skinkraft product but I didn't get any result...This app is totally useless"
It is good product for me because it shouted my skin
The worst customer service ever. I had a query regarding my product.they didn't contact me first .they only connect me when it's time for my next order.and when i receive today one product is missing. Hope to get a call from them or have my product return nd get my money back.otherwise byy i am not gonna order anything after that.two time order and both time i have to complain.even if ur product work they make u regret ordering anything from them.i don't need any rply here from them.just call me
I am very disappointed with the service skinkraft has been giving these days. I have subscribed for a 6 month plan. My 1st month box got delivered on time. They forgot to ship my second month box. When I raised a ticket they shipped 2 boxes at a time. And now within 4 days of delivering the 2 boxes the shipment of another box is scheduled. Means I am getting 3 boxes in one month. Which is useless. Also they don't have a proper customer care service in place. No proper grievance portal.
May issue is not getting resolved there is no any other contact is this your customer service
"Worst app, if we have any issues they won't even reply anything, guys please don't download this appüòñ"
"Please dont go for it,just a waste of money, I have been using since more than 25 days doesn't see any difference at all, even my face becomes darken after using this. Fake products."
They r nothing but fraud... They doesn't give the accurate product... I ordered my shampoo but they gave another old shampoo
"Hey, this isn't a review for this app, but my skin has become even worse after using the recommended products, maybe it doesn't suit all the skin type but I'm seriously very disappointed. I get worse breakouts than before and in a very large quantity."
It's not showing Where is my order and nothing is loading ....
Very worst experience. No one looks after our quarries. There is no any representative who resolved our problem.
Very worse team.. my wife using this not getting that much result. If any doubt we sending mail for call back request.. but thay won't calling.. thay don't have customer service also.. really bad.
This app is not working properly i have been trying to take follow up since 10 days
Worst customer care service.. for one month I am sending mail for call back no one is calling... Of i use app it's not working for order
open pores k liye option nhi chal raha h .. y ??? üôÑüôÑ Very upset
Good
"Worst experience with the product as well as with the customer service. First of all products causes reaction on the skin, use any product from skinkraft it causes redness and itchiness. Skinkraft products has made my skin Worst. Irritang reminder for renewal and purchase of the product. If you call the customer service no reply or help on any issue."
The whole thing is a fassad I started using the products and got a few extra breakouts figured it's just the skin reacting to a new product but just kept getting worse they called me after 20 days of use I think I told them it's getting worse I have a lot of breakouts they'll say its repairing ur skin from withing so it'll make you breakout 2nd time they called I said I have been getting more breakouts than ever they said use 15 more days should go away it didn't bdw. Worst products ever
Maine product ko order kiya hai aur money pay bhi ki hai..magar abhi tak muje koi product recieved nahi hua...please help me
Big cheapest product nd useless....waste of money ..... Don't buy any product guys be carefulüëçüèª
Product is good... But.. App is not working properly...
Worst app
I didn't receive any response from your side
"This is really ridiculous I've ordered the product and paid the amount of Rs.999 but till now there is no tracking ID came and I've mailed also but there is no revert from the company apart from the automatic message and the whatsApp number till now there is no revert and the customer care number there is no assistance to reach out to the agents, please call me back. I'll never suggest this to anyone."
"Product are good but their services (App & Website) are the worst! You won't be able to order your next order according your wish and also your order will be neither shipped nor be delivered on time. Don't fall for their subscription plan. Once again, their services are worst!"
"Very poor service, I m trying to contact for my refund but no body give response or their customer support number also not workimg."
Hello skinkraft  I have issues with your service actually I order some products for my skin but when I receive package my moisturizing cleanser bottle was open and it's all over in box. Bottle was empty and I was contacted to you in your app and they said that your ticket is book and someone come to my place in 48 hours to clear all queries but no one is coming and I also send you email but in email also no one responded
ABSOLUTE AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!!! It's really disappointing as there is no way to get in touch with the team for any query.. Raised call back request for maybe 100 times but there is no response at all... The only response is to purchase the product that's it... There is no platform to respond to our query.. NO RECOMMENDATION GIVEN N NO MORE ORDERS TO SKINKRAFT.. ü§¨
"You people need to work on your App. It's the worst. It's showing me that I'll receive my order by 2nd April, but today is 5th April and I still didn't receive it. Very very disappointing."
The app doesn't run well and the hair product is very nice in the first and second use but after that it doesn't give the same result. And why the nutrition plan doesn't take follow-up?
"Not able to place my order. When I am trying to change the shipment address, keyboard is not popping out to type anything."
I ordered the products by solving quize depends on my skin type or issues but I get rashes and redness on my face... It's worst product... I raised ticket for return it but didn't get any response
Worst coustomer service no reply from office
This application does not work properly really disappointed please don't waste your time in this stupid application
They toked full amount 1000 rupes but they Dont send full prodect not good..
"The app doesn't works Properly! Tried lot of times restarting but I only get to see a blank screen...üëé So cannot reach farther to Try the products. Please help, it have so much of bugs."
skinkraft ki wajah se mere baal lambe or ghane ho gye hain jese mein chahti thi or hair fall bhi bht km ho gya hai thankyou so much skinkraft or iska hair serum to kamaal hai i recommend it to everyone
I purchased skin kraft product no uses its waste for money don't purchase it and also they told me we are not giving money back it's too sad skinkraft it's shameless
Amazing product with superb results I suggest both of who suffer from ance blimishis taning saging go to the skinkraft analysis your skin type an get your product to your doors outstanding results are there
Worst app and product in my life Pura app fraud hai ..order kiya tha ak product galty sai ..order to aaya nhi na hi cancel hora mara purai ‚Çπ chalai gai Aar sb dikhawa hai Na hi email ka reply dattai hai na hi call pick kartai hai So please jo bi yai par raha hai y√† rhi hai to 100 baar soch lana ..mari kari galty aap log mtt dhorana Aesai fraud product sai acha koi achai dermatologist ko dikhana Baki Satark rhai sawdhan rhai .jai bharat
Not open application... Not respond
It's really a good and trustable product. But please improve customer service quality. It's very bad. Do not take auto order as it will piss your customer off. Package of hair care is not good at all please work on it. And yes please improve in following delivery dates and information. As other famous app tries to provide products befor ETD and on. For product definitely 100stars. But services are not worthy.
"Useless company and products. The products they had sent me made my skin far more worse than it was. On top of that, these guys send a feedback form, and when you fill and submit it they say someone from the customer care would call to understand the issue. However, I didn't receive any call from anyone. But I did receive the monthly subscription message on time. They were about to send the exact same products without even fixing my issue. I unsubscribed."
"Excuse me, please reply to me I'm the one u (skinkraft) talked to but I don't know how to dm or message u. Is there any website in Google that can contact about the complain."
The most worst app it made more hairfall ü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢üëéüëé
üòçü•∞üòòüòáüòÑüòÉüòÅü•≥ü§©ü§©ü§©
I have ordered my products but there were no pop ups about my order...so i cancelled it!!after a week!!
"Not recommended at all, also the customer service is bad. I haven't received any response from them"
I have been using the SkinKraft Products from last 2 months but I'm not seeing any single change on my face.. So That's why I'm Uninstalling this app and don't want to continue with the Regime.
I ordered for the first time and I am so disappoint I got my delivery in very bad condition bottels leackage this is so bad
Worst app interface....no response from anyone....i want to make a complaint and options dont load on the app ..... Everytime they tell someone will contact you within 48 hrs and then then no response..... And when u try to raise a complain after some days.....they say its has been 30-40 days since your order...... They keep calling only to convince you to order... They just care about selling products.....not about feedback or complaints..... They dont care what happens to the customer.
No customer support pathetic response don't use this product very low quality of shampoo serum quality is also very bad . Not recommended
"Hey skincraft When to get the product back, I have mailed 4 times, have complained, no response really very Waste products and services, no value at all Customer's . I request please take the product and refund it ."
I am very very very much disappointed with skincraft services I get a bottle half filled and the bottle of gel full empty.....
"I am really disappointed as this is the first time I ordered something from skinkraft and I have received with missing products, broken bottle caps, and also bottles were half empty. Actuall I think I have received used product. Worst experience"
"ur products are such a money waste products ur products makes my skin tone darkened,& started acne and redness on my face üò≠üò≠mujhe meri skin pehli jesi chahiye üò† I'm going to complaint abhout ur products üò≠üò≠"
No cancelation products
My Order #3162228 .. Please request to you all don't use this.. I got many pimples redness allergic reaction on faces i get....No offline members contact me worst company response
Not what I ordered and also when I opened the box the serum bottle was almost empty because it was now i cant cancel the order nor they're contacting me I need a refund Never buy from here again very bad experience
Two of my product is totally broken and spilled and the customer service is not even reachable ü§¨
There is no option for cancelling the order. The only way for cancellation is either sending mail or give a call. I want to cancel my order so I sent a mail but there was no response whether the order is cancelled or not. Now if they send me the product what am I supposed to do ?
It is the worst app i have ever use the skin products doesn't even suit me my skin got even more pimples and I've been trying to reach there customer service but they are not even replying i don't want there product it's such a waste of money and i want my money back
I want my money back I don't order anything from this app. There is no payment status since 6 hours. And customer care is not available
I am actually trying to use this but I am to affred that my skin problem are not increased . So I many times trying to shop but after see all the comment im just not believing that it work or not .please give me some answer is this product is good for me üôèüôÅbecause I have a acne problem on my face for 5 years . In the age of 15 know my age is 19 but it was slowly decreased but always my skin looking red and too much sensitive And acne came always in there in my face not finished .
Wrong product received üòî
"Can you please share us any other support like on phone call or WhatsApp, Because App is not working properly, I also tried on my Laptop but it doesn't work. Is there any other method then please suggest."
Its a really worst app. So many bugs ....when i ordered one product..and back the process ..it again ordered the same item ...and now there is no cancellation option ...such a worst experience
Such a waste of money just they are attracted peoples with adds and customer service poor
Nice
Heyy I am totally disappointed with these products my skin becomes more worse pls change these products or give my money back. I am not satisfied at all with these products. And the app does not respond total waste of money
Products are good but website and application are not user friendly often it's too frustrating operating website and application.
It ask question and it tell to buy when you finish them it not show what products to we have to buy it like just give me money
Worst service ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
"I'm using Skinkraft products from last 7 to 8 months. I have no issues with products they are working well.. but, Initially the operating system was also good.. the constantly connected with me bt now from last 15 days I'm working on placing my order for this month's but none of there response is working üòñ on what's when I msg for my order they just send me some links, n none of the link form it is opening... The I connected with email but no response üòï This is soo irritating üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
"Hi I am very much disappointed by the services. I need to renew my order and I raised the ticket on January 26, 2022 till now I didn't get any call nor even I received my order. I was in the touch from last so many days, they always raised the ticket but I never get a call. In the the app also there is not any feature to keep an eye on the tracking. Worst experience."
"The app is not working properly. I have been trying to take follow up since 4 days now. First I thought there is issue with me network. I tried switching network as well still the follow up option keeps on buffering and doesn't open. I won't say anything about the product yet, coz I have recently started using them. However, the app sucks..."

The products are great but the app is worst the company should really work on the app
"Very disappoint , no improvement in My skin texture , my acne is same as before , advertisement of this brand is so good but the results is nothing."
When i completed the quiz there was an error
Awesome
Good used
"I'm really disappointed with the products by skinkraft , my skin has become more worst than before, I just had light pigmentation around my lips , so I took skin id questionnaire and bought the products, I bought 3 boxes on thier words that your skin will get better bt after 3 months I'm writing the review ,I'm totally disappointed , my skin seems swollen n reddish n dull n black all over the face,I have spoiled my face using these products , my face was much better before, I regret using this ."
Please give some means of contacting you people I'm done with robots.other than that the product is absolutely good.
Product is good. But order system is very bad
I have placed the order for skin and hair products but still now there's no response. Still it is showing only 1st step completed.
Pathetic customer service.. absolutely rubbish!!!! No way to call customer support no responses on chat
Good
Nice
Just fake product waste of money üí∞üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°
Disgusting app i think so its really help
"Sorry that was my misunderstanding whatever I had posted, they called me and cleared my doubts and also abt refund, thanku skinkraft"
Very bad experience
There is no option for cancellation
And so annoying this aaps bcoz if you don't even order for next box but they are delivered they just do what ever they want. And I don't find where is cancel options. please firstly you ask they want or not üôè
Best and best app üòçüòç
Excellent
I don't know what to say about the customer care dpt. of this app ..I have ordered my product but I don't know whether it is coming or not ..only computerised message comes from customer care..no one is there to resolve the issue...I think I have to cancel the order
Best app ever for skin
I used the product its nt work and many times ill make complaint but there z no any response worst customercare service and before ordered they said product z nt work means they can refund my money but nw I make more complaint no response and waste of money how can i get refund very cheating method cheated my money
I am only getting white screen when iam clicking on know your skin don't know what's wrong
Worst app
Hadd ghatiya order place krne k bad kaha s cancl krna h pta hi n chl rh ..option hi opn n ho rh
Good
worst apppppp
I just installed the app and go through 'Take skin ID' and selected all the information related to my skin problems. But at the end it is showing blank white screen and nothing is happening. No idea whether the information is saved and I would get a product based on that. I'm just feeling irritated as I did this several times and the same issue is there. What to do? I'll give 5 stars if my current issue with the app is resolved and get the results in my skin as well.
I'm happy with my SkinKraft products results :)
I used this app to order customized skin care order. These products are amazing and are customized to suite you skin type.
I am trying 100 times know about my skin analysis but no response..I am very dispointed
"Hi,looking very user friendly app"
".i couldn't select my skin type yet.. as i select the complete option, screen goes black and stop there..view analysis page not open , but price detailing page opens very fast ü§£ Disaster!!!"
What kind of an idiotic app how many times do I have to reload
I bought skinkraft twice month and still not get the result instead of result after using skinkraft my face is getting pimples.. Just waste of money and wrost product ever I have used
Very disappointed me
"There is 1000 discount on moisturizer, but what skinkraft actually doing they remove little quantity of product from it"
"Worst apps ever after the skin test, there is no result just blank loss of time"
Worst products no changes in past two months on my face I THINK THEY HIRED FAKE OR PAID PEOPLE TO PROMOTE THERE PRODUCT.
The products are pretty good. But the customer service is pathetic. I've been trying to reach out to them but yet no response has been received. The amount gets deducted yet the order doesn't gets placed.
"Worst experience using skinkraft no effect visible, since 1 month."
Not able to see the results of questionnaire I filled. I did it thrice and all I could see was a blank page. Horrible app!!
Good prodact
Don't work.wrost app ever seen
Happy to be in contact for the issues. And waiting to give my best review when product shows good result.
My open por option cannot work
"Worst app ever , dont download this app if you want to buy skinkraft product just go through on their website cause this horrible app took forever to load"
I've been using this product aa mont h now i did not get any result yet i dont really know weather i should continue using this product or switch to other product ...may be this skinkraft product does not suit me
USELESS APP DON'T BUY IT'S PRODUCTS üëéüëéüëéüëé
Well we are on play store so what I am elaborating is about the app this is quite irritating because it have a lot of bugs sometimes it also becomes difficult to handle.It takes about 1-2 days for you to contact to the executive.You can't get any information about the next box coming. But if we jump to the product absolutely a üí• it's amazing you can feel your nourished skin from 1st day. You can see your dark spots decreasing in just 2 to 3 weeks.You can feel your glowing shiny skin from day 1
I was purchasing a suncream product but company deliver for fake product this suncream packaging full fake. this app was fraud me .returne option not working. skinkraft helping or not .pls do something this application was delivered fake product .this is really skinkraft application or not .do something company
Please improve the ui of it it's so confusing
"If a company fraudulently pays an online order, it will call you and ask you if you have received your order, but in case of delivery, you will receive a product with 2 variants and if you do not activate a PN number, you will not receive an answer."
Very bad customer service no proper response from the team regarding the issue
Not working Indian skin
doesn't work properly..hang every now and then
Please add for lips also I am suffering from lip pigmentation please add products for it
"App and web site is not woking,severl time m doing same for know my hair...worst"
The app is not working it was hang
"My customized regimen is doing very very good. Mobile app is so useful and it has all features like follow-ups, reviews enabled too."
Good
The best hair treatment I've ever took so far ... Has shown great results within 2 months... But the app is a bit problematic otherwise the products are the best
"Worst product ever I have used in my life, my hair fall then usual after using these products."
No option for contacting customer care. Contact us option is not working as per customer needs only showing the option according to the company. No grievances redressal mechanism. Toll free number is useless only saying the things which suits the company. Products are not working as expected. Quantity of products are much less than for the use of 1 month.
Yes no response from them and the one who come to deliver that person will ll cl just once if it's engage or something else they ll cancel order
App is very slow and irritating it stopped in between need to improve much more...
Delivered my order after 1 month
"App is full of bugs. Entire buying process is such a hassle. No proper response from the team. They take ages to respond. Misleading and useless representatives, can't get a simple answer for a querry."
It is an amazing product! I will strongly recommend. The skin product works wonders !! I had dark black patches which tremendously decreased Thanks to Skincraft I am loving this product
"It""s very lol app... It is a very useless app, skin craft does not deliver an order from these and they say a lot. I am saying about you skinkraft... you are not able to delivery the order... close you app right now okkk...."
Don't trust them there is no guarantee. if your product is leaked they will never solve the issue.
This app does not open the my shop page...where should I go n check the products and deals???ü§®üßê
Now day skinkraf full of problems not customer support just making unusual promise with boots not getting call back not getting proper ordr as per add
Worst company and worst products as I order shampoo for me and they are totally waste as I used the products my hair fall increased a lot and no volume and hair is completely dry. So I asked refund and they say raised a ticket and their respective will reach us but no one reach us they just say that they tired to reach us. No one is sorting the issue and they are refund number does not work and worst service.
I can't change my name
Customer care service is not good I can't cancel the order
"I have placed an order #2656844 on 15 Oct 21 and called your customer support department to cancel the order, but your customer support department said that the order has been despatched and if I will cancel the order on delivery then I will be able to get my refund money of rs 749. So I didn't receive the order and cancelled order. But till now I have not received my refund money of rs 749 in my phonepe account. It's been already 10 days.Please do send me my refund money as it's urgent."
The app is not working properly i am answering the questions and it was hanged
I'm very much satisfied and happy to have come across this product company. Stopped using all those extreme products and regimes
"I ordered 3 hair products of pakage ( shampoo, seum and conditioner)but didn't received serum cheater y will they take order if they cannot send it"
Iam using skincraft product it's not working insted giving me additional pimples I am confused to trust I think I wasted my money nd getting scoldings is anyone responsible for this I want an immediate reply though

Fake app do not give any products only subscription after he cancel order
Horrible app! does not work after a point of time in questionnaire for skin even after refreshing .it doesn't work at all.just terrible!üòîüò°
Xtra time west. Bad quishion
"Hasnt been a great experience so far. Using this customised formula since 15 days but havent got any changes on my skin, ya it feels good for a while aftr cleansing the face but no such practical changes. Got a msg for feedback and replied with my concern but yet to get a reply or any response from their side. As written in the describtion ""if the product doesnot support wilm try to change the deliver different product or refund"" whereas in my case it doest seem happening so....."
Very bad customer care services since it's Customized product I was lil confused on how to use it but I tried multiple time no reply from them
Weste of money ü§¨
I just installed and before using I decided to go through reviews..I immediately uninstall the aap after reading all reviews because this is worst this is not same as shown on social media . One thing that surprised me is that after having so many negative reviews and complaints they didn't even answer any single one .
"Such a bad experience ,I have ordered haircare product and paid it. I did'nt get any notification and they cancelled my order and has'nt returned my money."
They never gave points for refrel and if you review product only 5star ratings will apear.
WORST kind of experience..customer support doesn't exist at all.. i placed an order and paid for it but on delivery it was labelled as COD order and i needed to pay for it..no means of getting in touch with customer support team regarding refund. It seems that the company is being run by a bunch of faudsters.
Very nice product ...i love this product
Amazing
Excellent product I love it
I love the product very much I feel good
What a rubbish customer support you have...I have been trying to reach you for days but no use.Is this what you call your best customer service...
Not getting satisfactory result.
Skin analysis questionere is not finished in the last screen. Pleaee go thru it.
I wanted to ask as there isn't any smell in the serum Or moisturizer.. The fragrance is only in the cleanser? Please confirm about the fragrance? Until n unless I get my answer? I won't edit the review stars!
My Skin profile questions are not working ..How can I answer my skin questions??
Bekar hai ye skin craft lgane ke bad he face me react kr gya dane hone lge hai aur customer care kb se contact kr rhe hu lkn koi responce nhe hai ye sirf becufe bnate hai customer ko ....bad Experience please please don't buy thz product ...aap kise skin doctor ko dkha lo itne he paise me aapka face shi kr dyega lkn ye skin craft wale becufe bnate hi sb...bkwas product
Am really happy with Skinkraft. This is the first product which suited to me as I hv sensitive skin. Otherwise I had to go through various experiments and suffer with pus pimples. Thank you Skinkraft for making my life easier...
I have been using this product for the last one week. My skin feels soft and smooth.Also the dark spots have reduced considerably. I recommend skinkraft to anyone dealing with acne issues. Really loving it‚ù£Ô∏è
After applying skin craft for one week initially i can see some changes in my face..The cleanser is so good it brings a shine texture in the face and i really like the product and suggests everyone who wants to have a clean face can go for this product with no doubt
Very nice
good
I am unable to complete the process. I am answering the questions so that they suggest the suitable product but after 8-9 question it was not processed. Very bad app seriously
"1, told me I'll get handcream on next order when i reviewed , and haven't got yet 2, told me I'll get sk coins when i referred to friends and delivered to them still i haven't got a single coins yet which can convert into products 3, told me I'll get free product and there is also missing I feel like betrayed i was played like im dumb Very disappointed. I'll choose another the body shop brand from now on Scams...!!!"
Worst customer service
Thanks sinkraft
I love it ü™¥
Its good
"Money deducted and showing no orders , fraud will just take money and nobody repsonds afterwards"
Worst products I had taken skincraft products when I used it it produced acne and burning sensation for that I had contacted customer care so they r least bothered they send only one msg due to covid they r working with minimal staff v vl contact u soon. but after more than 20 times contacting no one communicate me till now now today one msg came from Mr sindhuji for asking next month order m fed up so in the end I m writting my experience with skincraft. So pls don't buy skincraft products.
Donot buy product from this company Beware:Harmfull chemicals used in products but company claims 100 % safe .by applying it's product itdamage face and while contacting no response from company I will give 0 rating if there is option .
Nice
"I used one of their shampoos which led to side effect on my forehead skin with severe pimples, dark spots and skin irritation. Highly NOT recommended !"
"Skinkraft products are amazing, I can see the changes on my face in just one week."
Contact Us isn't working
Exlent product osam
Amazing productsüòä
I took hair care subspriction by paying 999.... These products turned out to be a disaster for my hair... They had mentioned that it is safe for chemically treated hair but these hopeless products removed kertain from hair which was maintained since 6 months and even left them as jute threads... This is so disappointing... Jo dikhate ho vo kroge bhi kbhi?? Agr refund possible hai toh krdo plz... Atlst 400 or dal k apne L'Oreal k products toh le skti hu...üòèüòè useless products. ...
My skin dull not work this product do not suport customer care not refund my money skin is very dull and do not clear my skin and light spot blackheads proplems increase not purches this product total west money not sport team
Skinkraft is a single skin care product brand which is fully customized with trusted doctors. which gives almost accurate formula for your skin care & solution for your skin blemishes. It completely change my looks from pimples to clear skin. Now I don't need any makeup to hide those blemishes. Valu for money. or you can say pocket friendly. I specially recommend it to who have oily skin.
"The packaging was very good, the products are nice.. felt good from first use...:-)"
I paid online while ordering and after ordering my order got canceled and tried to contact skinkarft but they are not responding by any mode of communication.
Great
Please check the number 1 time to know that the number is working or not. Given in the app for refunding the money because it does not work I have tried I have plased order but I wanted to know that customer care is working or not so I made call and then I realized that the number is not working and then when the delivery boy came I said him to cancel the order and then I was able to cancel the order the company says that it will refund your money but customer care doesn't work.
It awesome my skin is already shinning

It's awesome..m loving it
Good skin cream with combo pack. It is working for my skin.
This product has some magic.
Nice products
Very good Very good
The products are worth it!
"The products are good from what I have seen but this is trash. Please update and fix the bugs, I couldn't fill the skin profile because of some options cannot be selected randomly (they won't work or respond to my touch)."
Very bad experience no option to return or cancel the product to get the refund. No customer support. Better to buy with the branded app so that you can get your refund or cancel the product. Do not buy the products if you are not sure as you have to beg to them to contact you. They only provide you link and on call there are no option. #extremelybadexperience #skinkraft
Good
I used it for first tym....I get the results from 1st use.
Best products....I love itüôÇüôÇ
