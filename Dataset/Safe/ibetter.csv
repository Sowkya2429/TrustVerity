Can you check the reminder options? Mine is missing Friday and Saturday options for whatever reason. In general I like the app and I did the upgrade.
I would like to have a pop up to record emotion on the widget
"The app is really great but however a big problem is like when I set a goal for 7 days, After 7 days I completed it doesn't make any big change it just stays. And also Turning of the progress also doesn't help much. And if I delete that the whole history will be also deleted. So add a *Achieve* button. That'll mark it as a completed goal. And not show it again but keep the history"
"GOOD APP , BUT IT IS NOT FREE , AND I HAVE NOTHING TO PURCHASE IT , PLZZ SHOW SOME FEATURE FOR POORS LIKE ME LIKE WATCHING ADS ETC"
good
I like it when you save to the cloud and sync data
Great
nice app 😊
Very good app with simple widget

"Already purchased iBetter Pro, but app urged me to UPGRADE again when I tried to add a new habit."
Please i just upgraded the app and played the 3.19$ but nothing really had changed I can't still after 5 days of payment add new habits above 3
很有设计感的app，一眼倾心。希望icon能继续增加，现在还比较有限。
It's a chinese app. They can't respect their neighbours borders and sovereignty so how can they be trusted with one's privacy. So uninstalling it
"Im currently using pro version, 5 star for this app."
An amazing habit app with colourful incentives which makes us want to stick to our newly formed habits.
Found this app difficult to use. Came across a another that works for me.
I've finally found a good app for habit tracking!
