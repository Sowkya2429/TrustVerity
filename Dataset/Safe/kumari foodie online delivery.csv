"Delivery charges are exorbitant! 131/- for 8.2 kms 👏👏👏 I tried ordering one item for 500/-, I saw the delivery fees and closed it. Country chicken -1 kg - 500/-. Indha orru le dan kozhi iruka ila velioor le irundu varuda??? Edit: My place: Nadaikavu, tried placing order for 1 kg chicken - 500/- Delivery charge showing 131/- Yepdi katum? App le katum..."
I ordered 2 arun family pack ice cream of 500ml and got charged 50rs more than MRP for each ice cream excluding delivery fee and taxes. I really don't understand how this adds up. Poor service...
Nice app ♥️☺️
Very worst and waste app
Order's are to late and delivery charges nearly 100rs. Customer care also not satisfied. Unable to track over order also once I got msg like food delivery done after that I call delivery person at that time he is telling now only picked food from that particular Hotel. Very very worst app. If we ordered food at 10:30 AM then food will reach nearly 1:30 PM-2:30 PM. Even near by 2km hotel situation is like this. It's really one of the unsatisfied food delivery app.
Everything was okay. But app needs many optimisation everytime it take more time for loading. It take more delivery time compared to another delivery apps.
"1) Worst customer care ever. Even though it will be their mistake they will call and shout at you. 2) Your food will never reach you in 45 mins or so. If you plan to eat lunch tomorrow order tonight itself. 3) This app is slower than government websites. You wait, wait, and wait until your hunger goes away."
I like delivery partner vichu boy he is amazing fast answering calls without ringing 😊 and provide correct solution order status and I am fourth time ordering everytime vichu boy pickup my order. additionally I am asked to delivery partner bring miranda and some snacks🤗 I want this type delivery partner. anyhow thanks to Kumari app
"I am 8 months pregnant lady I ordered food from Kumari foodie . Main road to my house 2 km . , No road . Fully forest place. that time nobody available my house I requested to delivery executive deliver my order with walk . his name vichu Vijay really superb he walk and delivered my order I am so happy . Thank you Kumari foodie"
Very Good ❣️
Ordered r super fast can can get the food in 4 hrs...
It's been one and half hours since I ordered food. After one hour I called the delivery boy but he spoke rudely. After that I called the customer care and informed. Then he delivered the food after one and half hours and again he spoke rudely. Hereafter I won't order through this app. Worst service ever.
"Its been two hours since I ordered food. Customer care and the delivery guy is not picking the call. This was good for a while, but it's time to quit using this"

If you like to pay 25%extra you can order to this apk
Try to go to the shop and eat or take parcel by visiting the restaurant. If your are buying food from kumari foodie app then your are paying extra 20% from hotel food price and more than 100rs for delivery. You are wasting too much money. Even if you go by car also you won't have to pay too much. Just think of it 🤔 😕 why we are paying too much for delivery.
Average delivery time 1h:30minutes
Awesome
Worth👌 app to order food 😋
Worst service...if u order for lunch they ll bring it for dinner....better go to hotel .... otherwise u ll loose ur peace of mind.....
Not picking calls nor delivering food.

"Bad Experience Yesterday I ordered food in 7.30 PM. 9.30PM only i received my parcel. It happened earlier as well, but yesterday the experience was much worse.I will uninstall the application due to yesterday's bad experience"
"Don't order food in this app, worst experience. Delivered food after 3 hrs. By that time hunger is gone. Food got wasted. The paickup time is more,"
Very worst service. I have ordered food. They told that order will be late. If you cancel It will be added to your wallet. Worst service.
"⚠️If you are ordering urgent in kumari foodie! Better you go by yourself and buy foods. Because they don't even care for there customer service. If the food is not available they'll let you know just 2 hours later only, at that time your hunger may gone. There's a bug in the app too. It's not even detecting my location."
Worst app and worst customer support I ordered food and waited for 3 hrs (not delivered) No response while call .. Waste of time .ordering in this app Delivery guy worst speak.. Overall(-10 ) can be given to this app service . I won't recommend any of my friends or relatives to place order in this app. I have to suggest that any one can order food for next day. Don't ask me to get your customer support to tell about this review Don't tell its a customer support. Is below average of primary.cls.
I first time ordered food from Kumari foodie . My delivery partner Ranjith sir he is amazing delivered item quickly. Thank you team .
Recent times worest service.1.30 hours waiting orders .please solve this problem.this problem today
Super fast delivery with good customer care service
Good App.. Need to add more Hotels
"Very nice app 👍 great service, delivered securely on time and good customer care service 😊"
Very nice app. Very fast delivery and good customer service 🤩😍
Very useful app❤️fast delivery 👍
Fraudulent .. we ordered 20 dosas forbreakfast for a family function at 10am .we got food at 12.30 around lunchtime by a school boy who appeared to be drunk. We got only 10 dosas that looked home cooked .when we called the hotel they confirmed that the delivery guy didn't get it from their hotel. Customer care was irresponsible.they didn't refund. What more can you expect from a fraudulent cheaters
Worst customer service ever..... I had complaint about not properly cooked foods from their ventors and they didn't take any actions regarding my complaints... Dears Kanyakumarians don't risk your loveable family members life by ordering food through those cheap people
Very bad experience on food delivery and it's quality
Worst app ever... If you order food today they will delivered next day .. Don't waste your time to install this junk..
Price for food is very EXPENSIVE. There are plenty of other apps which provide food at low price . Kumari foodie charging 55rs for one Naan in a hotel. Same hotel if you go directly it is 25 rs . 30rs extra for one naan.. This is a scam.
Nice app
I loved these app
Worst response ever seen!
The verification is not working I can't oder in the app
Super
Extremely funny notifications good customer service
Thanks for the immediate response to my query
I got the common otp 1234 inside of the app.I called to the customer care and confirmed it. Quick responses
I can't get OTP to login.
Worst App OTP Prblm
OTP NOT GENERATED
Fantastic app. Super dooper🥰😍
Super nice
Good customer support quick response to call
"It is not available in Delhi Update: by name it is not understandable that it is only for Kanyakumari district, I read all details of this app but it is not mentioned anywhere that it is only available in Kanyakumar, you have to mention it so that user can know it is not present in their City and they will not download and saving their time simultaneously"
Super app
Super
Great combo offers and festival season offers....good delivery team
Worst app. Breakfastku order panuna lunck time ku kondu varuvanga. Refund ketathuka mela ketu disturb panuna tha amount credit akum. Emergency ku oru food order panuna 15 or 20 mins kulla customer care la irunthu call varum 'sir antha product ila athuku alternative ah vera product venumnanu' product ilana yethuku app la vaikanum. Very worst app.
"Nice App. 😍 low delivery charge, more coupon offers and daily combos. Fabulous experience"
Fantastic App. I am appreciating your new innovative thinking. When some prominent food delivery apps gives there service to the urban cities you have focused the rural villages. Hats of you guys. You have take online food delivery all over the rural villages of Kumari. It's a great think to our Nanjil Nadu.
Good obedient and fast delivery
The application was Very User-friendly and Services are also good❤️
Super Fast delivery. But I dont know why the people of Kumari dont appreciate the emerging new inovations. How many one star rating but I didn't feel anything like that. If you dont appreciate new innovations means dont spread any nagativivity among others. For Marthandam to Aruvikarai I got my product within 1 hour
Stupid service. If you order lunch. You can take it as dinner
"Chennai le andha traffic le kuda pasanga mudinja alavile sikrama kondu kodupange, yen na ange competition heavy. Inge traffic ile yenda prachnai ila, irundalum, heavy delay.

Thu... Worst delivery service... Irresponsible customer care executive...
"Worst experience ever I ordered food in colachel with online payment and they placed order , after 10 min they cancelled my order without informing me or neither with notification ,by believing this app I have been waited for an hour ,finally I didn't get my food ,they didn't pay back my money too,,, so guys don't install waste of money and waste of time...they didn't update any foods if they r out of stock .."
Best app with super fast delivery. During in the rain also
Please don't buy anything using this app.. worst client service.. not even responding to the calls.. taking more than 1 hour of time for delivery.. worst fellow.. guys don't waste your money
The foods available in hotel not showing in the app while ordering so plzz clear it fast
Wonderful app
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. Then the traveler in the dark Thanks you for your tiny spark, How could he see where to go, If you did not twinkle so? In the dark blue sky you keep, Often through my curtains peep For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky. As y"
Don't place order for emergency because they are taking more than 2 to 3 hours this is continuously followed by delivery partners today also I am facing the bad experience
One of the worst delivery system..Every time I wait for 1.5 hours for a delivery
You have to order the Lunch at Morning to get it on time or else you will end up eating the Lunch at Dinner. Sick of waiting 😓
All the staggering offerings are to be had right here on this app for online food delivery from local to our customer doorsteps and it’s far in reality extremely good to use this app.
"Worst customer service, Took long time to deliver than the promised time, Need to follow up for Delivery. Owner dont know customers pain.Please dont use this app."
I can't login to this app. When i try to login it shows some error and immediately comes out of that app. Very worst
Very worst customer service delivery. Not even responding to call after the payment. Have waited for more than 3 hours to get the food delivered. Worst food delivery app ever.
Good

Good to see such apps in our hometown and app ui is an user friendly one.Kindly look into the address add section where we are not able to add any numbers there like house number .
"Still need improvement in user interface and should be online payment option. Delivery charges is high, if you introduce delivery charges for free on orders above Rs 500 /- I love this app.. Kumarianzzz rocks Vazha tamil"

"Finally, the much needed app for Kanniyakumari people. Add few more restaurants which are cost effective, such that middle class people also can be benefitted."
App is really good to use without any bugs or issue. Very fast delivery than expected. First ever time in Kanyakumari District. Delivery boys service and gesture great and appreciable. Good quality and quantity. Go for it! Without a doubt.
