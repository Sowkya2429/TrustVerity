"Give this a 4 1/2 stars. There was a lot of talking between characters, storyline was very creative. The morphing & triangles were tricky but I'm glad I could go back and find them. Only irritating item to me was had to return to the ""wanderlust"" title page a couple of times before playing and a lot when playing the extra games. Love that the guide is included."
"This is very different from the other friendly fox games and I'm really not keen on it, too much screen tapping and puzzles that don't make sense."
Wow! This is a great game. Great adventure and wicked sense of humor. Great play!
"great game! worth the money. great story, long game play , great characters, awesome puzzles."
"I usually enjoy this developers games, however this one I found to be frustrating and awkward. Many times, the objects that need to be used make zero sense. A lot of times you have to click something several times for it to work, or you click the hint button and it tells you to do the exact same thing you tried several time to do. It's just frustrating."
Have played this before. Really enjoyed it.
A lot of fun - not supposed to be taken seriously but to relax with - lots of puzzles and engaging characters - more please!
So far it's good..just the picture is so tiny it hard to see.

"Was fun till I purchased the game, then I got stuck in the sky and can not move on."
"Loved the free demo! Not too difficult,not too easy, (plus you can choose your difficult lever from easy, medium to hard). The story was super cute & really clever. Def recommend!"
"Love all your games. They seem a bit different than other ones I've played, but I love what you've done, brilliant thanks, guys. 5 * all day long."
U can only play for a little while and then they want u to buy the full game don't waste your time downloading it
"While I don't mind the different format, I found a lot of the gameplay to be cumbersome and, honestly, not that fun. The puzzles were fine, but trying to figure out what items were playable and what went together was confusing. I'm not new to point and clicks, and i really like most FF games, but this one was unintuitive enough to lose my interest. I do like changing up the faces and format."
Absolutely mental and pretty funny too.
"Top tier game! Even had me giggling at some stages. Graphics were brilliant. Storyline was great and engaging. Characters were on point and very well thought out. A little on the hard side, thank god for easy mode, it may have become a little frustrating. Definitely worth the money, well done üëè"
Good value for the money as the game is very long. It was different than most games of this genre. I found it too challenging at times but that's just me.
Loads if fun!
"I loved this game so much. The retro part. Mini games that I haven't played 19,000 times in other games. Splendid job the creators did. Just not like all the other games."
Great game! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Words, items to small"
The print is way too small
Not quite so keen on this one. Much harder than normal. Had to use the guide a lot and would never have built the trampoline without it. I really prefer your normal format of games. But I am sure other's will relish the challenge of a slightly different approach.
"I used to love Friendly Fox Games, but I'm super disappointed they're going with Mad Head now. It seems like the quality has gone way down. üò≠ Just looking at the difference between this game and the previous one is huge. Sad to say goodbye to these games. ‚òπ"
"Started out good. But got to be old style gaming (like Donkey Kong). I know this is for variations and to be different, but got real old fast...especially in the bonus game."
Game is good but there are some glitches with selecting object and same happens with mini games...sadly.
Absolutely the best game I have played in years!!!
This was such a great game! It was pretty long with bonus level. The story was interesting great characters and some good comedy. This is definitely worth buying I really enjoyed this one.
"Really great game. I laughed my way through and it was a delight to get unusual game play. It was such a delight all the way through. Good story if slightly strange which makes it better. A really good combo betwix Mad Head and Friendly Fox . Well done , much more peeps thank you."
won't work on laptop.
Keep them coming!!! Cool game!!!
It's getting better as you go along
"Loved this! A long game that's definitely worth the money. Also, I love Collins. I found the way he breaks the 4th wall very entertaining üòÇ please keep bringing him back."
Different and fun! Mostly because it's different from the same old same old! Good job!!
"Really good game. Longer than most. You won't be disappointed, I have never played a game this funny. But also I play the second hardest level and it was frustrating...wait until you meet Colin, very funny guy and he talks to you...lol"
"Favorite Friendly Fox game so far, and very happy to see MadHead Games!"
Great job with this one! I loved Collins!
"Loved it! I liked that the style of this game was really different from the normal style (although I love the normal style, it was a nice change up.) I really enjoyed playing it, and I can't wait for the next Friendly Fox game to be released!"
Another fantastic addition! Thank you for making mad head pc games available to us! You guys are awesome.
Love it send more please
"Wow!!! At first I was not impressed, but I have never gotten a bad game from you. I am glad I purchased this! Nice long game, very challenging, and the extras were awesome!"
This is a really neat game. I like the little surprises in the game üòâ over all very enjoyable.
Very fun time waster!
"Awesome game, you guys make the best games. Game play, controls and no glitches. I would highly recommend this game and all of their games."
