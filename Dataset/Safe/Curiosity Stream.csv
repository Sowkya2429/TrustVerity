0,I will be like you guys Halley and Smokey Tavern! Remember that I come in piece Brescia Zordiack
1,"I purchased a yearly subscription and I can barely even use the service. I've reached out to support on multiple occasions, and the issue is still there, at this point support isn't even replying to my emails, live chat says their engineers are still working on the ticket with no update. I can't use the service and I paid for a year....total waste of $$. no support to fix their services that barely function."
2,"The app is relying on the android os to verify if there is an internet connection or not which is just lazy coding. I have a firewall so the ""android system:1000"" service is prevented to connecting to the net for security/privacy, so at an educated guess this is what the CS app is using instead of just bloody trying to connect to curiositystream domain....."
3,I CANNOT MANAGE MY PLAN. THERE IS NO WAY TO ACCESS MY PLAN EITHER IN THE APP OR THRU GOOGLE PLAY STORE
4,This got way too expensive and I can find better stuff on YouTube for free
5,Why does my Lenovo M10 Plus (3rd gen) tablet [Android 12] now show CS like it's a phone? It's like there's a phone in portrait mode in the middle of my landscape oriented tablet. I hope this additional information clears up that this isn't a phone.
6,Movie won't play
7,"Some of the presenters overuse cheesy narratives for effect. Ludicrous statements like ""space isn't the last frontier - the insect world is"". Really!? Enough of the hyperbole. The platform seems mostly factual and has good multimedia content. I originally gave it 3 stars and was pretty blunt (I admit I am easily offended). I guess my biggest complaint is that the ""academic elite"" simply cannot control their liberal agenda. You can sure tell which side of the political landscape they are on."
8,There I a problem connecting to Curiosity Stream
9,Cannot manage my plan within the app. That's very shady.
10,Have paid through amazon prime video but cant watch from curiosity main application... this is not good
11,"I love the content on Curiosity Stream especially for the price. The problem is I've found that the downloads feature is pretty poor. I will click ""Download"" on a video and if I leave the app, the download will seemingly stop. The worst part is, when you restart the download, it starts over. It does not save the content it supposedly already downloaded. This creates an infinite loop making downloads impossible unless you leave the app open during the whole process, which can be a while."
12,"Endless docs & stories, great for a boomer like me!"
13,"It is the worst app ever I used. I am sorry, guys, but you are just frauding our money. Please stop it. Even youtube is much better than you guys, style up men and grow. We are not here to waste time. Please,"
14,"Lineup is okay, could be better. But it's the functionality with Chromecast that has been a pain. There's always trouble with linking or having the video start properly when I rewind. Every now and then, it lags, too."
15,Forgot I had this. Went to open it on my tv and remembered why I stopped using. It doesn't fully load everything so can't pick much to watch. Like there's blank squares tht has nothing like the list can't populate properly. Definitely canceling subscription
16,Curiosity strain app on Roku keeps locking up. Makes me get out of the app to get to content
17,Do not subscribe. It is nearly impossible to cancel.
18,Good
19,"Looks like there might be some good content, but I can't get it to play on Chromecast. Every other steaming video service I've used works on Chromecast at least most of the time, but I've never been able to successfully cast Curiosity Steam on my TV."
20,Amazing real content
21,Has some really good shows and affordable too. You'll really learn.
22,Service sucks. It is choppy and freezes. Trying to cancel my service and there is NO option to do so!!! I am beginning to smell attorney interaction! These guys are complete scams.
23,"Is now worthless, All my saved videos under ""my stuff"" disappear. Long episodes like ""Giants"" showing 52' play for 2 minutes and then go to next episode where the same thing happens,"
24,I'd like to rank higher but my watch list keeps self-emptying for no reason after I spend lots of time searching for stuff I wanna watch. I'll add something to my watch list and it just won't appear there. Makes it hard due to the huge volume of video options and I can't immediately remember the 2-dozen and more items I thought I had saved for later but now I need to find them again and I guess write it down on paper??
25,"Fun, educational, interesting easy to stream content."
26,"No ""try before you buy"" option."
27,"Download speeds are unacceptably slow, queuing multiple downloads causes them to stop completely I think I will cancel my subscription. Upgrade your servers, these slow speeds for a paid service is unacceptable. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to download a 25 minute video. Response to your comment because the review system doesn't let me respond. I asked for a refund and they ignored me, I'm going to ask my bank to reverse the transaction because you guys suck"
28,I really like the app but i wish it wasnt so glitchy a lot of the series dont work very well
29,"Isues on SO Android TV 11, is not marking the watched movies as on tablet version of Android 11, a lot of people are now watching on tv with Android tv now so is very important to fix this!"
30,"Error loading video message on Samsung tablet. Note how this app as a strong ""one star"" rating. This service is really bad. Although curiosity stream is cheap, I won't be renewing. Even ""cheap"" is overpriced when the content is limited and the app does not work. REALLY BAD folks."
31,App only works in portrait (vertical) mode. Full screen landscape is preferred and recommended when viewing videos.
32,"Can't log into the app. Have updated my password twice and I keep getting an ""JSON Parse error: unexpected token: e"" error. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app."
33,"Good content, however the use of the app, navigation, subtitles, etc. are all a headache, incluiding finding content you left unfinished. If you use it on multiple devices it's impossible to find were you left watching last time. Subtitles extremely often malfunction, pause and rewind also don't work. Sometimes you want to watch someting but just won't work. So... Very interesting content, the problem is the interface."
34,I had signed up for your app in 2021 as there was a discount. Last year it got renewed as I forgot to cancel it and I didn't see reminder emails. This year I cancelled in advance and yet got billed. Please help. The email I have already sent.
35,Every video is in the history channel perspective that does not focus on education but rather entertainment
36,"The content is great, but the app is awful. On my tv, it's choppy and if I pause, it comes up with a network error. The interface is complicated and I am never quite sure what I am looking at. I would just add it to my Amazon prime but it was a gift so I have to use the native app."
37,"the application will force you to use portrait mode no matter your tablet settings. many times it will fail to play videos and switch to casting mode, even when there are no devices around listening for castings. it is a shame as the content is good but the experience in trying to consume the content is awful. please do not reply to contact help via mail and describe the issue, they're easily reproducible and many customers report the same problems, just fix the application please."
38,Pleasant
39,Although you must pay I think it's a great value for what you get. Uninterrupted programs. A much needed application.
40,"Great app, would prefer more true crime docs. Like Netflix but a bigger range that would be nice. Other than that great app."
41,"Can I use my Google Rewards points to pay for a year's subscription? If so, how?"
42,"I downloaded and paid for this app twice!!! When I log in, it is still saying I need to pay again and will not let me access any of the content, even though I have paid twice. This app is a scam."
43,I still like it but constant buffering
44,"The app is okay. Very basic. Costumer support via Android TV is not great. For Android it's okay. Overall, great content but poor execution and support"
45,Content is very good but app needs improvement in its UI. Try to take inspiration from netflix that's super good compared to this.
46,"All the creators promote this app by saying you'll get exclusive content. They post the exact same thing here as they do on YouTube. It's not even posted early. There are a bunch of videos on this service, but it is just a paid back door to YouTube. A rip-off. Pay for YouTube premium and watch ad free plus get YouTube music. Nebula isn't any better."
47,"Forget the app, just use the website. Curiosity Stream is an excellent service, I have been subscribed for a few years. But their apps are terrible. The android app crashes frequently (I use both an old and a new chromebook). The FireTV app is difficult to navigate and get to what you want to see (Firestick). Would also be nice if a ""Continue Watching"" option was presented from the home screen, it's kinda buried now. I've deleted the app now and just bookmarked the web page."
48,"While the content is wonderfully, I cancelled my subscription year ago and now I see in my account I was just charged 20 dollars for this app. You lost all credibility with me"
49,"I can't login anymore after the march 2023 update. The app keeps returning a parse error. It already had a tonne of issues, like slow downloads, search function that didn't work, etc. But this parse error take the cake."
50,I can't get this to load on my television. I got the app from the LG store for my LG tv and it won't load. I will not pay for another month as what's the point if it won't play on the tv
51,Grat content and cheap subscription❤ worth it
52,"I played with it before getting irritated with it. Like all the others, it was quite enthusiastic to take the money, before having any real opportunity to test it out. I noticed no ability to search by keywords for desired content, instead having to flick flick flick through the thumbnails to seek out interesting items from those shown. It was like a giant channel flicking exercise. And I just tired of it."
53,"Virtually impossible to get out of Curiosity Stream, can not find how to cancel subscription......very annoying in fact, I don't have the app on my phone, I hate paying for something I do not use....."
54,"I subscribed 4 years ago and watched a few programs and never watched it again. I've let it renew annually all this time due to how cheap it is but now I'm trying to cancel and it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to cancel. Unless youre absolutely committed to keeping this service for life, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE."
55,"This WAS a great app. Now it crashes and claims ""network error."" No longer worth the subscription."
56,"I can't watch ANYTHING. All I ever see is ""error loading video / TRY AGAIN"" for each and everything I try to watch. Simply does not work!"
57,"I like the way how it can't stream to my chrome cast TV, even though stream is in its name. Very meta."
58,"Hey bro, where are my 4k videos ?"
59,Kindly bring Transparent Subtitle View in the app similar as web. And Zoom screen freature is also missing in the app.
60,Excellent choice of documentaries!
61,Your broken app won't let me log in
62,"I purchased the Smart Bundle annual plan for which I have already been charged 80$+ (including taxes). However, after purchasing the plan I noticed one of the subscriptions the plan comes with is not available in India and no disclaimer was provided on the website for the same. There has been no resolution for the issue however the team falsely promised to extend the subscription by 3 months. After frequent reminders, I noticed the plan has been deactivated & I have been cheated out of my money."
63,Awesome learning on this app
64,What a waste of time. Can't even do the payments properly. Most of the episodes are available on YouTube.
65,Programming not what I am looking for.
66,"This app sucks, worst app designed ever thanks for making me unsubscribe"
67,This platform has one of the best collection of independent documentaries. I'm happy I subscribed. The only downside is; the app navigation can sometimes be complicated hence the four stars 🌟
68,"The content is well-produced and styled along the lines of early History Channel documentaries. However, also much like the History Channel, the subjects often skew toward sensational and even lurid pop history rather than being truly educational. Regarding the app itself, it seems robust enough although it's somewhat clunky compared to competitors like YouTube."
69,"Great content. App needs work. Not optimised for television (Google TV) or android tablets. I cant store offline videos on SD card. The rewind and forward functions are finicky. And much more to go on. Developers, Curiosity Stream has a big potential to become really popular, just make the user experience across all platforms great please!"
70,Awesome
71,One day trial is needed before collection of money.
72,It does not work properly The contents are very nice I really enjoy with the application however it does not work properly especially in a smart TV. It turns itself off every 3 minutes. It needs to be improved
73,This is basically a scam. They will entice you to sign up for a monthly subscription while claiming it is bundled with other services such as nebula. As soon as u register they will remove access to bundled services and u have to deal with their ATTROCIOUS customer service. I'm so disappointed that so many creators I respected have switched to this platform. Stay away from this shady company
74,Good content but too many playback issues.
75,"Please fix your app or delete it !!! Same as others, frozens & crashes. Also i wish there was a PC Windows app as well, why there isnt one? Also try pls to add Ancient Aliens series... Thank you, for the reply. I 'm using it on web browser on PC, works better but sadly you guys don't have a Microsoft program/app... why? Also no subtitles for other languages but we pay for it lol."
76,"I love this app; however, I usually watch it in my LG tv. The problem is that, on the LG tv, the My Stuff menu is not there. So if I start a series, I have to hope I remember what it was so I can watch other episodes. I finally figured out that I can see my history on the Android app.. but would be nice just to see it on my LG tv"
77,Good programs but user interface is not optimal and massive bugs when you cast on TV .
78,Poor selection
79,SCAM - NO REFUND
80,"Documentary movies, series. Great selection for educational."
81,"App sucks, when you finally get a video to load it freezes and locks the screen, can't back out, can't stop the video, have to force stop the app if you can get into settings, if not you have to shut down your phone, now 3 dollars isn't a lot of money but waste is waste, and that seems all I'm with this subscription is wasting my money. And looking through the comments seems all you doing to fix the problem is by apologizing."
82,"Bought a year's subscription with the promise I'd get access to Nebula, ended up with only a subscription to Curiosity with less than average content. Would not recommend"
83,"The content is excellent but I'm here to rate the integration with the Google Chromecast with Google TV. The app for that device freezes often and the search does not work. I found the only way to get episodes that I specifically want to search for is to use this Android app and put them on my watch list, then wait for them to appear on the watch list on the app on my Chromecast. The app for the Google Chromecast is in serious need of fixing. I also cannot cast to it directly from Android."
84,"I love and support Curiosity Stream. The pricing is good, the content is good. The app, however, needs some more love. The videos stop randomly and will only continue briefly after force closing the app and deleting the cache. Plenty of storage and memory on the device left. The lack of automatically going to the next episode is a strange omission, since it's so obvious that you'd think it's deliberately omitted."
85,Needs better support for larger format devices such as tablets.
86,"Great content on curiosity stream , lots of variety at a good price and everything so far seems of a hood quality. The app is a little slow to get going but once it foes it works fine , could probably just do with a few missing features but all in all great value."
87,"The content itself is very solid with good variety. That being said the app interface extremely complicated, it takes a long time to load content (and yes, I have very good wifi- all my other streaming services work perfectly), and episodes tend to stop randomly. I don't think it's a worth it purchase at this point, but definitely has the potential to be."
88,"NEW SHOWS ADDED EVERY WEEK IS A LIE! Ive subscribed for a year (my mistake), and what ive observed is NO NEW show is being added every week! Its a deception, a lie! They only add at most is 1 show about every 3-6 months. And previously they say ""thousand videos"". Where is it?? Look at their app and you would see about only 50+ videos. Unsubscribed after a year."
89,put account settings and billing in app
90,Excellent content but the app does not work well
91,Like the content but can't cast to tv
92,Solo falta que esté en español
93,"Seemed good but not, you have to subscribe to a plan"
94,"Continuous crashing on samsung tab smt520, app not formatted for tablet display forcing listings in portrait mode, having to flip tablet to see listings in portrait and video in landscape. Listing are confusing opening a specific selection in the main screen will result in a new screen with the selected video in addition with other unrelated videos. it just doesn't make any sense. I am very disappointed with the experience and will not renew the subscription again."
95,No response from help desk
96,"I really love the service, but this app is pretty much garbage. I just had a problem renewing my subscription, and the app has no options to manage your plan or your account at all. You can only delete your account. The only solution you have is to go to your computer and log in through a web browser to manage your account. What's the point of having a mobile app then?"
97,Hi i hope you can add malay subtitle.. tq so much
98,Does what it says and had so much interesting content
99,never used the app but the channel is great
100,"Hi, it's working now"
101,"There is a bug with Chromecast. After the first video ends, the next one you want to play gets played on the phone instead of the chromecast. Even though chromecast shows the curiosity stream background image."
102,Fills in time slots...
103,"I like the platform very much. But the app freezes the video all the time. It is frustrating. I can deal with the lack of features, but please atleast make the video run smoothly."
104,"Well as for content is not bad, I bought the lifetime subscription but then I find out is not 4K. Everything is pixelated. I tried calling customer service and they said that I cannot upgrade or changing my service. I give it 3 starts because now I am stuck with a pixelated service but the content is good."
105,My fav!!
106,"I really want to give this app a positive review, but it has sooooo many flaws. It wont remove a show from the currently watching list once done, it does not keep track of your watch history accurately, and recently the queue is broken. I love all the documentaries in one place, however, please spend our subscription money on fixing the app ASAP."
107,Content is awesome! But the app is laggy during play. It takes two seconds to pause video. Please check the performance on Android tablets too.
108,"Good content, however the app is made by morons and is basically unusable!!!"
109,Have to paid minimum $2.99
110,"The button links below a playing video are labeled with text that is much too small to read. I have a large screen phone, and I can only make out ""Download"". The rest remain a mystery."
111,"I used to love this app when it was free. It sucks that poor people can't have access to educational content that is fact checked. O well I guess it's back to ""reptilians"" and how people with type O blood can't be harmed by them. lol"
112,"Content great, app is very buggy - duration is 2 minutes on everything, can't watch past that point. Please fix this issue as I am unable to use my subscription with the app in its current state."
113,Please kindly fix the very lagging videos. Everything on the platform works so smoothly until the streamed videos. Images are freezed and the sound never matches up the scenes. I love your contents but I cant watch anything on the app.
114,None of your videos are playing. If I click on any video it just shows a photo.
115,"No new videos are added on a regular basis, i think only 1 video per month is added. same videos. They claim its 1000+ videos, but i think it ls more like only 50+ videos."
116,I love this app.
117,I love the content on Curiosity Stream. However you will be in Buffering Hell if you attempt to watch content on the app.
118,Chromecast use is appallingly bad.
119,Lots of content
120,"Firetv app is really buggy. Playback is not very smooth. And also I ones I disable subtitles, video quality selection also getting reset."
121,"Curiosity Stream has some great content but the app is just terrible. The home page is cluttered and just plain looks a mess. Apparently the app is completely unable to track what was watched last and it doesn't play the episodes of a series in order. Instead the app keeps going back to a series that was watched earlier, or to the ""you may also like"" list and auto plays some arbitrary episode that was already watched."
122,"I can't even log in. I press login and it says ""cannot be fetched"""
123,"Terrible experience. I accidentally signed up before I chose my billing or my subscription, but once you do that this way you can't put in your discount code anywhere. So stupid. You just lost an annual customer. That was the subscription I was trying to sign up for."
124,"Great Roku channel, sucky app. The app has told me like eight times that my password is wrong. It's not. I've even reset it and copied and pasted. However, doesn't give me any trouble at home on the Roku channel. Kinda sucks I can't watch on my phone or tablet though"
125,stream can NOT be played while calling on whatsapp. even though i can stream youtube just fine
126,"Lot of interesting content but the app itself is orrendous. You cannot anymore save stuff to the watchlist. The downloads on local are almost impossible to finish, I think I was able to do it once with 15 retries. Please add the possibility to remove stuff from the ""currently watching"" that ended up there by accident. The UX and the UI are generally a nightmare."
127,Keeps closing on my HP Chromebook once a selection is made
128,"The app won't work while on wifi. I don't know why this is happening, but it worn download or stream while I'm connected to my home or work wifi. Avery other app on ym phone works fine but this one. Content seems good, but I can't speak for the app without using up all of my Mobile data."
129,"I like the content, but Chromecast doesn't allow you to change play speed, and there is no native app for my Google TV which is a nuisance"
130,Worst experience so far. These people cannot fix the issue of their own application and charge premiums for their services. Wrote them twice first time I got a response pointing finger towards Google and second time no response. You guys are no better than the scammers we come across on internet. No wonder why your ratings are this low on play store and I should have read the reviews and checked the ratings before downloading the application.
131,"Love the programming, but they need to add the ability to create profiles and they should have a ""continue watching"" section so you can pick up where you left off."
132,Beware of price. In app you pay 21 euro a year for HD option. On website you pay 11 USD for the same option. That is twice the amount!
133,"For Premium subscription charged double I was charged 2 times and they are not reponded for the refund. Dont buy this, if you mistakenly bought you have to loose your money"
134,Keeps logging out in 7 seconds each time :(
135,"All was well for most of first year. Now app crashes, freezes, etc. It's really becoming a pain. I see many other reviews with same comment. Are you gonna fix this CURIOSITY STREAM? Companies die by ignoring their paying customers."
136,"I'm not happy at all. The service took an annual payment from me and I didn't get a receipt, so I knew about that when I saw I have less money on my account. Moreover, I didn't manage to cancel the plan earlier, because after I logged in after several months, it was showing me the ad to upgrade to premium, but at the moment my plan was active. I thought I had already cancelled my subscription earlier and this annual payment was a complete surprise for me. I even can't request a refund! Angry!"
137,"Hello guys just subbed, but i have a question i want to gift this to a person in my family who lives in Africa can you help me with it ?"
138,I cancelled my subscription but was billed for renewal anyway.
139,Really like the app. Are you guys gonna put it on ps5?
140,"Horrid app.. Stopped working with chromecast all together. Extremely glitchy, stops streaming randomly, can't stay connected, and doesn't continue episodes. The app is bad enough app it's not worth purchasing the service, because content doesn't matter if you can never get it to play. If I could give it negative stars I would."
141,"This is really bad. Casting is awful, and queuing is a nightmare. It can't keep track of what you have watched."
142,"Fantastic streaming service, offers exactly what I need and is available on all sorts of platforms. Very respectful with push notifications, most streaming services I have to turn off notifications but this app is very infrequent and gives good notifications when to do have one. Very cheap. Only problem is there's no background steaming, I don't know the logistics behind how that works but being able to see or even hear while you're doing something else on your device would be nice. 5/5"
143,Fix casting
144,"Love the documentaries but lately can't connect. App says we're having a problem connecting to the internet, please try again. Makes the app worthless. I have an excellent internet connection. Guess I'll have to unsubscribe if I can ever connect."
145,"Edit my problem was fixed,, just took a little longer than I wanted but maybe I'm too impatient"
146,Absolutely useless... definitely not worth it because you can search anything what you want you'll get absolutely random videos that has nothing to do with what you're searching for... Viva La YouTube
147,"5 star content but poor app. Controls are annoying most of time. It may take several attempts ro get the app to do what is requested. Over time, it has gotten better but needs work."
148,Most content pre 2017
149,Nice app
150,"I was promised free nebula from a YouTube promo code, when I confirmed my subscription I had no access to nebula... huge waste of my money and I'm disappointed by the lack of commitment to promises"
151,Great content
152,Content wise I'll give 5 out 10 not what I expected. Also there are few good documentaries to our liking. However not the best.. hence decided to cancel. Horrible clients service. I had subscribed to this service last year unchecked the auto renewal box come this year they auto renewed me I called 2 days after when I realized it was auto renewed requesting for refund been denied. I fell like I have been scammed.
153,I'd love to watch the shows I found and would be happy to pay $20 a year for it. The app worked for a week and hasn't launched since. At this point I don't even have a way to cancel my subscription so I'm not paying another $20 next year. So disappointing...
154,"My problem is I am unable to watch videos in it. All I get is error, unable to load video. Try again. I have to use my laptop to watch any content."
155,"Why doesn't casting work? Thoroughly enjoying the content, but occasionally I would like to cast to my TV."
156,"Paying for something that often ""can't connect"" is very frustrating."
157,"The concept is great, there is good content, and I enjoy supporting alternatives to cable media. But the app definitely needs some work."
158,"Love it, I can always find something that interests me"
159,"Just doesn't work. My password wouldn't work so I reset it and it still says ""failed to fetch"" whatever that means. Same happens on the app"
160,"5* Content 2* App. Great Videos but the app itself is so slow, getting to watch the videos takes a lot of time unlike other platforms. Please increase the apps performance so i can jump into the good videos easily."
161,Doesn't allow background or screen off playing. Many people use documentaries to drift off to sleep. Learn your audience.
162,"Not bad onsidering the price, very affordable and accesible via Android smart phone, Android TV and Roku devices. Although I noticed lately that there haven't been new titles lately and I was wondering that it's because I'm only subscribed to the HD package."
163,"Too laggy and clunky, it needs some urgent work to be usable as one might expect."
164,"The app doesnt support for tablet, event already force it using samsung setting its a mess still. Pls fix it"
165,"It's worth the price. And best of all the curiositystream team was helpful when i was looking for support. As for the upgrade, i feel like the app keeps forgetting my watched video timeline length whenever i were to change video resolution. It's very inconvenient and sometimes frustrating."
166,They make is hard to find the subscription cancelation.
167,Love this streaming site!
168,"I really wish there was an option to give Negative Stars. It is a horrible app with very limited contents. Morover, they have virtually no Customer Service available, which is totally not acceptable for a paying customer. I have been trying to reach them and they respond once a month if you are lucky. DO NOT FALL FOR SPONSORED VIDEO ADS regarding Curiosity Stream and Nebula. Bdw, Both of these are kind of sister companies and Scam paid customers together."
169,App is aweful. Almost unusable. Content is still very good for the price on offer. There is some questionable content creeping in but over all there is alot here to like. Just get a new app developer please!
170,Love it
171,Mot entertaining for the Mind and Spirit
172,"Worthless app !!! I have had it two months and the 1st month i wwas only able to watch it on two days. This month was was amazing NOT, the damned thing hasnt loaded once. It requested payment today!!!! Hell no. A shame because i love the content."
173,"Every time I play a New video the video player stops at 1 minute and 59 seconds. I can't watch any video more than that. Please fix it, I want to watch some videos and this is stopping me to consume your content."
174,Flop
175,"Mostly great, please make the app rotate when holding my tablet horizontally. As of now, it does not."
176,"Scientific content without idiots-pretending-to-be-smart content like History, Discovery or NatGeo. That is, no scripted reality shows, no everything is aliens, no dead-end investigative documentaries."
177,"Been using this app for the past two years. Overall very satisfied. However, there can be a lot of improvements. A bit more thought in showcasing content would be much appreciated 👍."
178,Poor
179,"Despite what you'd think after seeing the ads, 95% of this content is on YouTube"
180,Bought this using a half as interesting promo and didn't get nebula :(
181,"The app is amazing! The content is delightful, whatsoever, the server seems instable, I have to reopen the app multiple times because the videos simply stop loading"
182,App is not working on android tv box
183,"Terrible app. Whenever I try to play anything it says ""error loading - try again""."
184,Far too many programs bashing Caucasians for it seems everything! I'm not racist in the slightest. Remember the Japanese wwll? Remember how Mr Amin threw out all Indians from Uganda! Mugabe in Zimbabwe. Go look how the Arabs had slave trade in zanzibar etc. They castrated Africans. Benin begged that the British navy to NOT block Spain Portugal France taking Africans sold by Africans to for labour. Its British navy who ended it! Africans continue to sell Africans dreams in people trafficking !
185,Really useful. Thank you for this app.
186,You got rid of First Man thats why I joined no longer want it if I can't watch that.
187,"I love the documentaries. I have an active suscription. However I am disappointed because the app doesn't work properly. It doesn't remember the exact place where you stop watching the film. And if you turn off Chromecast, the streaming continues in your phone. Finally the app is not accurate about remembering what programs you watched. It's a pity because I lost a lot of time trying to remember my last show seen. Now I have a piece of paper and take some notes but I think that's not the point!!"
188,"I cannot simply watch on my phone. After pressing ""play"" it shows that it is casting and nothing plays. Months ago I had had this problem and today I've tried again with the latest update. Content is great, but I'm not renovating subscription with this problem going on. I'm back. I've contacted the support and after following their instructions (delete the app, restart the phone and install the app) I can now watch on my phone."
189,"All of a sudden the app will only show mobile phone size on my 14"" Chromebook. I use the app because its casts with better quality than through a browser. Need a fix or I will have to cancel - I have had it for 3 years so seen most of the content."
190,"I have loved this subscription service so much for the past year. Recently the app has started telling me that ""there is a problem connecting to Curiosity stream and to check my internet connection, but my connection is just fine with upload speed at around 45 on wifi and it says the same message when I use my phone data. If an update fixes the issue I'll change my review because otherwise I love the shows and the app is easy to use."
191,Was gonna sign up but wanted to see what most are saying about the app. Have you fixed the common issues with the app? I'd hate to waste my money💰
192,"Curiosity steam has very nice content, but the app is problematic. The play button and forward backward buttons are not working properly. There is no way to play the videos."
193,Signed up through a nebula promotion link (TLDR Daily) and never got Nebula. I contacted costumer support and they didn't got back to me. UPDATE issue fixed
194,"After purchasing a subscription on Curiosity Stream's website, upon logging into the app, was confusingly prompted to pay for a second subscription unintentionally. Would really like to see a refund for this."
195,It's alright
196,"I have been refunded and can't be happier , thanks guys , I've only cancelled because I can't afford it, it's well worth the money, just with everything being so expensive ,it doesn't leave any Pennie's for treats unfortunately, but thanks again for my refund ,I totally appreciate it ☺️♥️"
197,Video quality is very bad even when set to 1080p
198,"Doesn't even launch?!? Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus on Android V10 I know the subscription is cheap, but... I have send error reports, please look into it ASAP!"
199,No way to cancel subscription from app or web page. Option is missing. Trying to call to cancel. Weak programming. Too bad
200,"Poor app design, difficult to navigate and explore content. The content is mostly dated and subpar, which is a shame really"
201,Would love but unable to handle the subscription. Screen needs to be able to rotate
202,Horrible is all I can say. Just so you can watch it won't do anything unless take your money. Greedy horrible and takers. Sad this is the way our world has become
203,"Getting worse instead of better. Recent app update rendered it unusable on Samsung Galaxy Tab with Android 11. No matter what I try to play it shows ""error playing video, try again""."
204,im wasting my subscription because the app is so frustrating to use. the minimized player only works half of the time and the brightness of the video cant be adjusted and is SO low
205,Please introduce cheaper regional prices for poor underdeveloped countries. I am from a very poor country and people live in poverty and hunger here. I want to watch documentaries.
206,"No matter what I do this thing lags and is blurry and overall the visual is less than stellar. I love the shows just not how they appear. Closed caption is always behind by at least four to five words. I expected better output. It's grainy like it's from my childhood. Irritates my eyes at times. Please fix this we literally use this for homeschool, so I would absolutely appreciate a better experience."
207,"The app does its job well (responsive, beautiful, intuitive) but can only ever be as good as the streaming service it channels, and while there’s a lot of great content available, there's a perplexing shortage of art docs. It's so bad that there isn't an Arts section -- closest you can get is Lifestyles -> Creativity, and even that's polluted by non-art documentaries. Worst of all, the search function isn't very intelligent, so searching ""Art"" brings up docs with the letters ""art"" in the name."
208,"The content is good but this is legitimately the worse streaming app there is. It feels like all of their budget went into marketing and funding shows. It's slow, the UI/UX is unintuitive, it's buggy, and crashes frequently. It also lacks basic features like being able to zoom to fit 21:9 aspect ratio, which sucks because they have content filmed in 21:9. I have a hard time believing any actual UI/UX designer or software engineer worked on this app. If they did, I'm embarrassed for you."
209,Both the app and website are laid out very poorly for video watchers. I haven't yet found a way to view all videos by a creator. I feel like there is so much more to this service I have not seen because the app and website are laid out too poorly to make it easy to search. I definitely will NOT be renewing my subscription. Very disappointed.
210,"Fabulous content, but needs some work. Please, please, please allow the app to lock its screen orientation (ie, portrait or landscape)."
211,Good content. But doesnt detect chromecast tv and no real workaround
212,Customer service for my problem fixed.
213,I love the content but why does it randomly stop casting and start playing the episode from the beginning but on my phone?
214,Love learning new things!
215,"I love science and learning so I think this app is a great idea. However, it's terrible when it comes to buffering. Even with top quality internet. Also, the app is confusing when pausing and playing after rewinding. On my Xbox trying to press play usually starts the video over unless I press up or something. It is not easily remembered. Makes shows unwatchable and is a roadblock towards learning through streaming services. This should be improved upon, literally for the sake of humanity."
216,Best streaming platform i've come across (for documentries) they have (great) documentries on everything and even a couple lectures on physics and science in general
217,Right off the top you gotta work on your app icon guys. It's not even symmetrical after it was downloaded. Make it look more professional if you can.
218,"On Sony tv, worst ever. Sees go away after war ching an episode. No 'continue watching' sectuion. Content good, but accessing through amZon"
219,"Content is cool! Sections are creatively titled however, the UI is terrible and slow. Why is the nebula app so much better than this? Should it not be similar or on par? Doesn't even have a mini player or plays in the background. Please update your UI"
220,"Like others, I appreciate the content but the app is awful. I can only cast one episode before having to restart the app to cast another. On my Samsung TV, the app crashes when you try to search and the browsing is impossible to do."
221,Terrible.
222,Too much expensive subscription.
223,Showing empty list in select a plan view so I cannot sign up
224,"Guys seriously! What the heck is with all the buffering. I have a good enough connection that a few 4K streams will run at the same time from other services. But just trying to watch a regular HD video on curiosity with nothing else using my connection at the same time is a struggle. I'm getting video buffering as often as every 10 seconds. Which is something I have not experienced in over a decade! The content is good, but it's freaking hard to actually get to watch it."
225,Very bad interface.
226,I just want to cast onto my smart TV. So far unable to do so .
227,Disappointing. Really poor app especially with casting and marginal content
228,This is epiccccccc and amazing
229,Still being charged months after cancelling. They take forever to respond to anything regarding my issue. Supposed to be a certain price per year but I am being charged every single month for their full rate.
230,"1st of all I want to experience for a month or so ,so what's ur plan .plz let me know . Informed me about ur trial.im serious about all of this I'm not like other guys who git enjoyed and further on disconnected."
231,"Stole my money! Even though I paid the $20, curiosity stream will not let me watch more than a few minutes of any show before telling me to pay them for the service again! I already paid!"
232,Had curiosity for months. Was okay.
233,"Some interesting content. App seems half finished though. Downloads stall. Can't play anything while downloading. Quality drops noticeably even on 50 megabit connection. I'm not contacting your help email, this doesn't seem specific to me and I'm not doing your debug for you :) hopefully app improves in future 🤞"
234,The screencast option is not working.
235,"Good. Could be better. Specifically, downloads are unacceptablely slow. I can download 4 Netflix movies in less time than a 30 min video."
236,Please how can i stop this app from charging fees from my bank account?
237,"The content is really good, but the Android app is unusable, terrible UX. I won't renew my subscription if it doesn't improve. I'm ok to pay more, but build something usable."
238,"Although a lot of stuff in the app work fine, the downloading speed is absolutely terrible when using this app, it takes around an hour to download roughly 500MB documentary eventhough my internet speed is 30MBps. Also, the screen just doesn't rotate when you need it to, especially when using the app on an android tablet. The content is great but the app isn't."
239,An easy-to-use app with really good content on it
240,"I love this app! It is not expensive at all, which I really appreciate and the documentaries are sooooo interesting! Thank you! 💕"
241,"Can't use the app comfortably on my tablet, as it is Portrait mode only. A shame, as I like the service. Will not renew my subscription if the app remains unuseable."
242,"Download does not work. The app either downloads extremely slow, or just hangs and does not download at all. It's pointless to even have the option to download. A shame as the content is great and would love to be able to watch when not in WiFi or mobile coverage."
243,"Its a huge bargain & the content is fantastic however the app for the mobile is absolutely terrible specifically when it comes to downloading which now seems to be impossible for me, only streaming is achievable due to this I use it mainly for TV viewing. The creaters need to scrap the current app and rebuild it as its now doing more damage than good for the brand."
244,This service never seems to work right. So fustrating. If I had not bought a one year subscription I'd have walked away already.
245,The app has no ability to play the next episode in a series and after you play the first episode it will not let you even start the next only the one you just played. Plus a multitude of other problems.
246,Excellent programs
247,Need to optimize app for Chrome OS tablets.
248,Why does this open in portrait mode only? On my tablet this is really annoying.
249,"I have free casting apps that work a million times better. It can't even figure out to cast the episode I'm clicking on but keeps starting things I've seen all over again. Literally have to disconnect from the Chromecast to be able to start the new episode. I'll edit to not call it ""pathetic"" cos it's simply not kind. I can see there's a ""now playing"" at the bottom but outside of my screen. It upsets me cos the app does so disjustice to amazing content. Content 5 stars. App: 1 star."
250,"Trash, garbage, waste of time, not worth the time."
251,"Two trips and still haven't successfully watched anything. Curiosity Stream's downloader is awful, slow and unreliable. Both times it would not let me watch anything I had downloaded, because something was still downloading. But could I stop the download? Nope. This app has pissed me off more than any in awhile."
252,"Fantastic. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews? Great, interesting content and a very low YEARLY subscription cost. Highly recomended"
253,Installed it on an android tablet but the interface keeps defaulting to phone size. So when in landscape position you have a narrow interface in the middle and huge blank space on both sides. Quickly turning the tablet to portrait and back fixes the interface which then stretches to fill the whole screen. But exiting a full screen video turns it back to phone mode. A surprising bug in 2022.
254,Its rad
255,"Awesome content, horrible app. The auto rotate setting doesnt work correctly, the downloads lock up, and every icon on the app has a 2 second delay. Very disappointing."
256,Many good and some excellent content. Sadly de app is very bad.
257,Excellent OTT platform.
258,"Great app, However one suggestion is the ability to browse in landscape mode. It appears this app only likes portrait mode. But switches to landscape when playing a video"
259,"The content is ok but the app has a lot of issues. It constantly forgets your place when you try to resume where you left off. Please put a ""resume watching button"" on the front page, I'm sick of digging through menus to find what I was last watching. The picture in picture is also bugged (I get 1/2 the video and a black bar). I will probably not renew my subscription because this app is so bugged."
260,Boring Same Material/ Auto-Rebill Scam
261,Works like a charm and I hope Curiosity will always stay! The amount of exclusive content is amazing! If you love educational videos then this is the best and cheapest platform! I use the app to cast to my Google Chromecast. Works perfect!
262,"I find the content to be excellent, but finding thst content is often problematic as the search function does not recognise what is being searched for even if it turns out to be name of the program/series"
263,"Content is great, but I'm encountering malfunctions for specific series, for example ancient engineering stopped after the colloseum episode and refuses to play the rest of the series. I've reinstalled the app, but no change. Could use some streamlining of the app. The fifth star for when all content is again available."
264,Poorly built app with subpar content
265,"Content is great, but the app is one of the glitchiest I've ever seen."
266,"It's okay. The video content is good where you can find it. The app is unable to comprehend the idea of an orientation lock and the fullscreen button is a lie; you can't watch documentaries in widescreen if your phone is at too steep an angle. I don't undertstand how that isn't fixed. There is no LGBT-centred content, despite a press release nearly 1 and a half years ago saying they would try better. I'm incredibly dissapointed. Explain this."
267,What is shown in international advertising is not available across the app. We live outside the US. I've never seen anything shown in a Facebook ad be available to me to view in Mexico. I am trying to cancel right now before my renewal in a few weeks and the app and Google play are going in circles.
268,"Really good app and platform, haven't had any issues so far. The only thing I'd like to see is an option to manually remove content from the ""Continue Watching"" section, it's annoying finishing a show/documentary and have it stay there."
269,No landscape mode support for an app that's designed to consume... landscape content is a deal breaker.
270,Always rorates 90 degrees of the device orientation. Support state that there's nothing that they can do about it. Notice that I then get the generic reply asking me to contact support. Considering when I did I was told there wasn't anything that they could do I would stay away and save your money.
271,Can't turn off autorotate. Why does this app need to override the system setting? Edit: Now they want me to contact them again. You already know about the bug don't ask me to contact the support team. YOU can contact the support team!
272,"App is hard to use and its hard to resume videos that you are in the middle of. There is no picture in picture, not good. Makes it hard to enjoy the content. [Update, I'm not why why Curiosity Stream replied with a canned response as if I found a bug. That's not want I said. It is simply not a good app compared with other video streaming apps. I'm removing a star because they've shown even less attention to detail in their reply.]"
273,I got this app so I could download and watch later offline. Well it won't work unless connected to wifi. All I get is a blank screen. Being looked into by Curiosity stream developers
274,Absolutely love this app
275,Very hard to unsubscribe
276,Terrible experience. Half the movies don't open. Very frustrating.
277,So far this is my first time trying it and if it works better than what I expected to I'll give it five stars until then you get one month to show me that you're better than what people say you are so remember you get one more trial from me okay
278,"I unsubscribed to Curiosity stream as the content they offer plumuted. They were adding content which was free to watch on YouTube (Crash course) Now they are back again, Adding new documentaries and I am again subscribing again."
279,Been trying to subscribe using promo code from YouTube to get access to nebula and pay with giogle play credit. Instructions are useless as it tells me to go to settings and them to manage account but there's no such option.
280,I don't think it's worth the cost just about everything available here is also free somewhere else to watch
281,"I'm enjoying the content, especially for the price, but I'm having a really rough time downloading content to watch offline. Stalls, slow or just never downloads at all."
282,"Plays ok on Samsung's S5E, So I downloaded several to take on holiday.It won't play clips that have been downloaded through the app,the app is useless!!! Might not renew subscription when my 3d year is due because of this😡 and also pathetic copy/pasted identical replys to all reviews that identify faults.Shame on you,pay a professional to make a useable app please😟"
283,Nice content
284,This app is not tab friendly!
285,"Beautiful content and very good price, however, you cannot play any video while downloading which is very annoying considering that it downloads incredibly slowly and only while the app is open. Please change that awful feature."
286,"The content and amount of interesting documentaries is nice, but the app doesn't work well at all. Overall the buttons and features don't work right, but the biggest problem is that any documentaries will heavily glitch after I've watched them, so I never get to watch a documentary for a second time. Please fix the app."
287,Geat content but the horrendous app spoils it all
288,"The app and content are good. But when I download a video to view offline, I cannot open the app without it crashing or bring me to a blank screen. So any offine content does not work"
289,Crashes every few minutes and cannot detect that my tablet is in landscape position....unusable at this time
290,Wow! What a great channel from where to learn the basics about more than dozens and dozens of subjects from every discipline imagined.
291,"Downloaded content does not play on Samsung 5e. Just says ""Error Loading""."
292,"I expected much better than what I'm getting! Additionally there appears to be NO WAY TO EXIT the app and exiting it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT! I want to be able to terminate it when I move to another video source, but the virtual buttons disappear completely, not allowing me to terminate it and move on. I'm running the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 tablet with Android 12. Frankly, I get better documentary content on Amazon Prime and Youtube than I do on Curiosity Stream!"
293,"The app is getting better , but having subtitles only in English and Spanish needs to be changed ."
294,"I always get an error loading on my cheap Acatel, wether I use data or wifi. Downloaded vids still have visual glitches and failure to load. This app sucks. Works well on my cheap laptop. Here for the WW2 docs. Thnx."
295,"(14th, August, 2021 Edit) It's a nice service with an affordable price. However, I would have given it 5-star if the application is more user-friendly. For example, If you jump to a specific second, the video will sometimes freeze and start from the beginning. It's really frustrating, as you will have to guess which second you were at. The content is 10/10, but the application itself is 5/10. (22nd, June 2022 Edit) The App is currently much better than before. Thanks! New App Review: 8/10"
296,"I need to devote more of my time and get a more thorough understanding of this App, with which, to give a good concise, written review. I do appreciate and enjoy the various aspects and subject criteria of the ”CuriosityStream"" unlike any other App I've visited. Just opened a trial subscription to the Applications' program available on Amazon. I'm enjoying the programming! Updated: 21 June 2022"
297,App keep closing. Very bad experience
298,Keeps Loading .... Good Movies Bad App.
299,"Don't buy, they will not let watch full videos if you buy and cancel subscription."
300,Content are very nice but uses a lot of data not preferable for consumers with limited data
301,"Videos won't play in app. Video window is silent and all black except for white error message says ""casting""."
302,Good streaming service
303,I switched on background play and it's no working
304,"The app crashes a lot, there are times where it runs well. The content is great but the app's stability isn't that good. I would recommend watching through the web."
305,Endless educational entertainment. Pretty much everything under the sun.
306,"Could not subscribe with gift card, app does not work well, prmo code sis not work. Says I can not use the gift card on Google account. Trying to get refund."
307,"really a great service! the app has some minor technical issues but I got used to them very quickly. yet I must say I'm a little disappointed with the quantity of the content: I had hoped for far more .. well just more. some things also are allready quite old (10+ years) which is fine but I would love to see more, long and up to date content - Universum by the ORF for example or more french productions."
308,Enjoy the content and being able to download but they never finish downloading and you cant watch anything if something is trying to download rendering the whole thing a waste of time
309,The app is always stuck in casting mode
310,Im giving 5 star to improve your app.
311,"13,000+ reviews, average 3 stars!!! I'm not paying before getting a 1 month trail."
312,"I have been a subscriber to curiosity stream since it was in beta,at that time i payed a really low rate for a lifetime membership. Just now in the middle of a show I am prompted to pay for a subscription? Uninstalled just now. Curiosity stream plese delete all of my personal data thats been collected unless of course youd rather me get into your system and start deleting things myself."
313,don't waste your time
314,"It would be lazy, and more than just a bit tacky, of me to copy and paste what I had to say about Nebula, so, I will give a short recap. Best bang for your buck! Thanks, again, to The Great War and Real Life Lore, (RLL), for steering me to Curiosity Stream and Nebula. And, bonus, there is not an Orwellian Big Brother elephant in the room."
315,"The premise of the service is good. However, I would be cancelling the subscription as the UI/UX, especially in the Android app, is not enjoyable. The media player does not have fullscreen support for phones with non-standard aspect ratios like the Galaxy S8, no way to speedup the videos like YouTube and Netflix, and the overall experience isn't as smooth and enjoyable as with other video streaming services. Probably will be back when/if the experience is better."
316,"Picture in picture doesn't work! I have gone through settings in the app, in my phone, etc. Netflix, prime and YouTube are able to give picture in picture, so it doesn't seem to be a problem with my phone. Please assist!"
317,I like the documentaries problem is they're not just downloading they lock up when I try to play them.
318,Good content but can't play what I download
319,If this app does not improve in a month when viewed via Chromecast I am going to stop subscription. Viewing via chromecast is so laggy. Video buffers for 2 minutes or more at times. Disvonnects from Chromecast. I seldom watch but when I do it is disappointing
320,"Rubbish connectivity, HORRENDOUS LAYOUT, overall a buggy mess. DOESNT EVEN GIVE YOU THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING A SUB CANCELLATION BUTTON IN APP. MAKE YOU HUNT HIGH AND LOW FOR IT. SCUMMY DOGS."
321,"I'm having trouble playing videos without ""buffering"" every 30 seconds - 2 minutes"
322,"It Doesn't work, That's not a good sign for a new subscriber!"
323,"*App build issue* I like the service, but the app is incredibly annoying as it automatically opens in the phones background and you can't close the app by swiping it away in the background like other apps. It just stays there and had a padlock icon and won't close. It also uses battery and drains approx 6% of my battery just because its open in the background. Annoying as hell due to this technical issue."
324,"Ordered the service with annual subscription and tried it for literally 5 minutes, didn't like it. So I cancelled my subscription and then asked for a refund and ""they don't do refunds"". This service basically stole $15 of my money. You should be ashamed of this, I want my money back."
325,"Paying for some free documentaries , in which most of them are bs , no way."
326,"The app was fine before update and it's not playing until download the video. Each time ""play back option is disabled"" shown on the screen..plz resolve the issue"
327,I can't apply promo code on this app
328,Wonderful shows. Always educational and powerful.
329,"The only thing that frustrated with the functionality would be documentaries that don't always change their status to watched. If this was corrected and I'm offered a bit more variety I could quite easily give a rating of 10 out of 10, or in this case 5/5."
330,"Maybe the content is good, if you are able to eek it out of this app. I, myself, wouldn't know because using it is an exercise in frustration. For example, you start a playlist/channel/series. The video ends and the next autoplayed vid is random and unrelated, not the next in the series. Why? And that is the best case as it usually autoplays constantly the same unrelated SEEN vid. Also, background play simply does not work or works for less than a minute after the screen is off and then crashes."
331,"I purchased this as a package deal with NEBULA app. I'm not able to log in to Nebula,it recognizes my login but not my password. I wanted this primarily for NEBULA,Curiosity Stream was just an extra. EDIT: Turns out I had to reset the password through email just to get access to Nebula for this promo. Would have been nice if Curiosity Stream added some wording was added to that effect: You won't actually get access to your promo deal until you change the mystery password. thanks??"
332,"The content is worth 5 stars. The app is not. That's the end of my previous review. I've taken another star off because the app is just not getting better. When you click on a series you see a list of episodes, unless you're connected to a Chromecast. Then it just gives you the option to play whichever episode it chooses. After that it stops. The newer platform of the app is prettier but the previous one worked. This isn't the first streaming app to market. Get it together."
333,The app claims there is a network issue and doesn't work at all. Every other streaming app works including Nebula and it also works in the browser. I suspect it doesn't even try because I use a wired ethernet conection instead of a wireless one.
334,"Open the app and it just hangs on the splash page. With all of the reviews hammering on how bad the app is, why don't you all spend the money and fix it before you go out of business?."
335,"Excellent content! Totally worth it! The contents of this app are really heart touching! Some improvements are needed in the app like accurately resuming from the last played position, and remembering the choice of quality in which i play the video!"
336,Bring back the Walking With franchise and fix that search bar!
337,How do i pay thru play store as due to rbi issues my credit card paymrnt not going thru.
338,"Ok, 31 may 2022. rate: PASS Good job guys, now is just a matter of getting more science and animal documentaries, but the redesign works. GOOD JOB. FINALLY. i'll be keeping my subscription as long as you keep bringing more science and wild-life documentaries. Hope BBC gives you a license so i can finally be able to watch their programs. Only problem is that background play and PiP in broken(do you guys really test the app before launching the update?)"
339,The app doesn't let me log in.
340,Worst app. It's not even opening
341,"Has some good content , Need to unsubscribe, my card got hacked and they are trying to get payment through that card now my new card has been hacked."
342,App consistently rotates upside down or away from my viewing angle making navigating and viewing impossible
343,Terrible constant refreshing and freezing cant watch most shows its just a mess of an app that a streaming service app cannot stream is beyond me totally ruined the experience fix your damn streaming app cause right now it isnt a stream but a stagnant pond developing scum yeah this is how disgusted I am Part 2 So you have completely redesigned your app to give us a better experience how about giving us something that just effing works band aids when surgery is needed FIX IT
344,Boring choices
345,"It's has really good documentaries, definitely worth the subscription. Everything from historical WWII documentaries to Fusion Power documentaries. The app is also no longer super buggy and it's a lot easier to use. However, there is still room for improvement for user interface."
346,Can't sign in
347,Moving presentation
348,"The app needs more polishing, specifically autoplay, orientation, long startup time, laggy-ish interface and stuff. The search field has a weird problem where as you type the text keeps duplicating and borks the whole input. Have to delete bogus characters carefully to finally be able to search for something. Very irritating. Edit: They fixed it, much better now :)"
349,"I don't understand how the downloads can take longer than watching the episodes themselves. High quality is supposedly 1GB per hour. I can download 1 GB in less than 1 minute from Steam and the like. So it's definitely not my connection. Not to mention 1GB per hour is pretty bad. A reasonable bitrate would result in 2-3GB/h at 1080p. The compression artifacts on the shows I've seen were pretty bad. On top of all this, you can't even download while watching."
350,Horrible..... Why can't I open any plan? What the use of downloading if can't even open the app Or purchase any plan?
351,"What promised to be a superb documentary experience feels like a total waste of time and money when used on a tablet. The app is unusable (error loading, try again) for most video's and it seems to rotate always sideways instead of landscape. Unwatchable! Reported this issue to CS on both Samsung, and Medion devices. Devs need to speed up fixing this, or I fear for the future of CS. I'll update when things improve but for now 1 star because not usable as intended."
352,It's phone/portrait only. No tablet support.
353,"This is the best thing I've found in my entire life. UPDATE: This app used to run smoothly and shows played very well. Now the shows play choppy. Doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or 5g, the shows run very choppy. PLEASE FIX. 🙏🏼"
354,I want to sign up using a promo code but there's no option to use anything. It just forces me to pay out the total amount. Not really a good impression here.
355,Amazing
356,Amazing shows!!!! Love it
357,"I have a hard time trying to enjoy the app. Everytime I switch to another app and come back it crashes. It fails to remember where I left the videos, it just continues from wherever it feels like. And on top even when it's working it's extremely slow. It's sad because you have great content. I wish I could spend more time here learning stuff instead of on YouTube or other apps but this is literally insufferable."
358,"The content is good but I've been having playback issues on my Sony Android tv. At times,when I open the app, it just throws an error message ""playback failed"" and I have to reboot my tv for it to work."
359,"Content seems good, but the app is aweful. I have not had a successful download, which is what I subscribed for. Unfortunately, it's not even worth the low price point of $2.99. sorry guys."
360,Not android friendly.
361,"Great content but is the worst streaming app, terrible UI and UX"
362,Great selections of first class programs. Thank you.
363,"The app experience is baffling to me. Here I am watching a series and instead of playing the next episode of the series, it plays something totally unrelated. I have to manually get out of floating miniplayer and change it. Sometimes it says five episodes but you have to search up the name in order to get the rest of the series. It baffles me why this happens. Stupid app. Content wise, cool."
364,"User interface is terrible. It's a shame the content is great but it's terrible to use, my firestick is exactly the same. So I'll keep to using YouTube until they fix it"
365,Poor content. Or going by other comments maybe the UI is just so poor you can't find anything good. Either way I wouldn't bother if I were you
366,The experience of trying to use cast is a pain
367,"Well, at the end not worth the subscription. From good to excellent content but the app is a pain in the ars to use and shitnty support"
368,Worst user interface I ever use.
369,Great titles and very affordable!! Only 4 stars because app crashes frequently. But it's not that big if a deal to just relauch the app.
370,no longer works launch the app just says curiosity stream but nothing loads
371,"Nothing of quality, no good productions backed with shifty research and logic."
372,"I loved the app, they did an update and now it doesn't work at all. They suggested Uninstall the app and then reinstall it, worked once and now it doesn't work properly again."
373,The content is amazing but the download function never works. If i try to watch something on the go that i downloaded before it always says error loading the video. Really sad becaue the content is so great.
374,"offline mode is not working, When I open the downloaded movie I get a frozen black screen."
375,"Great selection of entertainment and information. Enjoy and learn more! Sorry, the app keeps crashing. Can't use it"
376,"Very disappointed. Downloads don't work (samsung S21 ultra). ""Error loading video, Try again"". Searched the error on your help pages, no hits. Otherwise app works well and content is great."
377,"The App has a lot of problems. It looks pretty Amateur. The content is OK. Would have liked to see more high quality nature documentaries. Some are pretty old. Definetely doesn't blow us away. Edit: The app is pretty much unusable. When trying to search for a documentary you start to type : ""Natur.."" Then the app will randomly repeat things I typed. Like this: ""Naturnaturnaturnaturnaturnatur"" then I can backspace it all and start the whole process with the next letter. Just awful."
378,Downloading within the app needs improvements. After very slow download speeds none of the titles downloaded will even playback...download error is all I get. The content is good but the user interface and app are simple terrible to use!
379,"I feel cheated. So I have downloaded this app, after paying yearly subscription to enjoy my time while on plan and on train. Unfortunately after downloading content, you cannot play it offline. You will get the message 'Playback is displayed while downloading', for movies You jave downloaded before. Forget about offline watching"
380,"App is now unplayable! Since the last update screen rotation is exactly opposite to what I want, no matter how I turn my device it always shows things at a 90 degree angle. Plus It keeps shutting down every time I push any button. Went from a 100% fan to absolute rubbish overnight. Unwatchable!"
381,PITA to cancel
382,"excelent content but a terrible app. i recommend uninstall the app and watch on mobile browser. And no, I won't contact the help of you guys. Simple... just rebuild the app for better UX."
383,"Curiosity Stream covers everything from history to science, from the past, present to the asperations of the future. With features like screen off background play to PiP mode! Curiosity Stream has you covered and provides tons to geek over. I haven't closed the app since I started using it."
384,Please fix the video downloading speed also the offline downloaded video that can't play.
385,"I was having problem to play the documentaries, but at the end it was an issue with my internet connection. The app is working smoothly now. Thanks."
386,"Full of bugs, i mean FULL of bugs, 75% of the time it won't play, or it wont work with Chrome cast or it will only work on Chrome cast, very annoyed"
387,Super bad experience. Has been facing download issue. It never downloads a content above 25% in my curiosity android application. And the mail response is very bad. I am regretting for the purchase with annual plan.
388,"Buggy, can't even download anything. It starts really fast but then instantly goes to a crawl and you need to forever close it and open it again. Repeat 1000 times for one video."
389,Can't tell you if I like it or not because it won't download to my android Samsung!
390,Royally pissed because I downloaded this last night after signing up and woke up this morning to discover it chewed up HALF MY MONTH'S DATA IN THE BACKGROUND while I was sleeping. I think it only stopped b/c I hit my limit. (It used 0.9 GB out of 2GB; no other app comes close) Seems like a good app otherwise- but turn off background data permission settings as soon as you install it!
391,"All of the content on Curiosity Stream is two years old or older. Also, whatever series there are only have five episodes or less. The number of titles they have is not as vast as they advertise. This company needs to update their content, as well as add new titles with more interesting topics."
392,Simply does not open so I can't give a review other than it is horrible.
393,"Could use more content, new stuff is slow to arrive"
394,app won't open. i used to enjoy Curiosity Stream a long time ago. but since i paid for a year the app never opens anymore 😔. they took the money and run..
395,Lots of content. New UI improvements are appreciated.
396,"Content is good, but even though I have high speed Internet connection, I often cannot stream a programme, and experience frequent stuttering and long pauses."
397,Literally cannot even skip through a video without having to start the entire thing all over again. Happening on a fire tablet 10 HD. Makes me regret the purchase.
398,"I started out loving this app and the last few ""updates"" have left the app more and more broken. If i tap on a series the episode list that shows is actually just different shows or documentaries instead of the actual episodes. When i finish watching an episode it doesn't go to the next episode it then skips to an entirely different program even though there are more episodes in the series im watching. It worse with the ""continue watching"" option. Please fix this so i can give 5*!"
399,"What a change from other streaming services. Lots of interesting documentries, shows about real relevant events, inventions and beyond. Like space beyond and other cool out of this world data. Getting the 4K subscription for a year was worth it to me, hands down"
