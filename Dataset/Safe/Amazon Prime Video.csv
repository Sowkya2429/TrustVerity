0,It honestly cracks me up at this point when I think how much money Amazon makes and how terrible this app is. The UI stinks and the app constantly crashes. Sometimes just turning the volume up or down will crash the app. LOL! Excellent work! ABSOLUTE GARBAGE FIRE.
1,Love it
2,Full screen not Play
3,Why is the video quality trash? The video quality keeps breaking. Netflix doesn't seem to be having these kinds of problems.
4,Good
5,"It's a bit hard to surf and find than Netfilx, but good."
6,No any new movies
7,Or Hindi org content chahiye
8,Not good
9,We can see stuff but can not download it üòï. Still it is a good app Thx
10,App is not working properly. When I played a movie first it took too much time to load then only audio was playing and screen was blank üòî.
11,Nice app
12,Excellent!!!
13,macam konto
14,Good app but many movies are not available in Hindi
15,Love it!
16,Nothing created new account and password west time.
17,Still getting that license service call failed error Playing in Google Chrome browser has no issue otherwise
18,Use this app on my ChromeBox computer. Gives me easy access to movies & TV Shows. UPDATE 7-3-2023 Lowered rating from 5 to 3 stars. Listings no longer shows If the movie/show is Prime. I have to select the movie/show to get information. Listing no longer shows if the movie/show is leaving Prime. Listing used to have a colored triangle showing number of days left in Prime. The notice now blends in with the text and ie easily missed. Please Bring back the old intefrace
19,Bug cant open
20,After subscription why we need to rent movies this is wrong boycott prime video They all making money
21,"Disgusting app. I am not able to login..üôÑeasily. Very slow touch response. Not easy to use the app. Amazon!.Please make it easy to use and ""redevelop your all apps"" & also make the latest and easy to use looking interface of your apps üòäüôÉ."
22,I am updating. Issue got resolved. I am changing my review. My play back was HORRIBLE. Videos were stuttering and freezing. What I did to FIX it was go to BOTH my amazon shopping app and prime video app and cleared the storage and the cache on both apps. I then rebooted my phone and everything started working. No more freezing and stuttering. Edit my review Its still freezing and stuttering. Will only work on shows that have add's. Still waiting for support to respond.
23,"Slow loading, when going out of the app for a second and coming back... Loading again, slow poor app"
24,Veriy fradu
25,Deaxdddd
26,best and cheapest aus film subscription service
27,"Hackable, pos !"
28,üòÉVery NiceüòÉ
29,Amazon has made it exceedingly difficult if not impossible to rent/buy in either app. Why even have separate apps if it's a glorified viewer. I'll just continue to rent on YouTube if they're the same price anyways
30,the best feature was the download icon at the bottom. Now gone with the latest version
31,The app is not working üò≠üò≠üò≠üòî https https plans guys can do the needful in the same company team
32,Now it works and no longer crashes after 2 seconds but now the quality won't fix it's self no matter what I do it's always at the lowest setting. Plz for the love of god fix this app and make it work like it's supposed to. side note: the audio sound's compressed and the audio sometimes goes out of sinc
33,Better than Disneyplus hotstar
34,over half the things i wanna watch.glitch with green in them
35,"Whenever I downloading something on prime my phone hangs for few minutes and then restart only then the download begins, it happens every time I tried every thing cleaning cache update the app, fresh reinstall but nothing works"
36,"I have tried 3 times to reinstall and get the code in my tv bt always error comes and show get new code, do something. I am prime member."
37,too late for waiting otp code. i think amazon must fix it
38,Monster High Presents: Karpet Merah Anugerah Seri Angkasa 2022
39,"I'm finding more and more, what I really want to watch I'm having to rent or buy. Also, more and more, the shows I decide to watch have adds. So I'm paying for Prime video.... then I'm having to rent what I want to watch. And if I don't have to rent the program then it's filled with adds! I'm confused, I thought that was the whole point in giving up cable!!!!"
40,Forget Captcha Problem
41,Very good movies
42,"Can't buy or rent videos on my phone anymore. Used to for years, as long as the app existed. Called customer support, when I quested and actually found a working number with living breathing ppl, and the woman acted like I was the new one to the planet, saying it's always been that way. When I showed proof otherwise she mocked me for not having a computer. So yeah, it kind of sucks more now that I can't buy or rent stuff anymore but that's less money to Amazon I guess. Terrible service too."
43,1 trail free hai kya bro
44,"make it to easy to purchase, my son gets on here and gets him self movies and nickelodeon!"
45,I have s23 ultra but app not working üòï
46,"It's unclear why Google rules don't allow in-app purchases for Prime. To do that you have to go to the website abd then go back to the app to watch. Awkward. I uninstalled the Play version and downloaded it from the Galaxy store where I can rent videos and make purchases. But Play is sneaky. It replaces the Samsung version even though automatic updates is turned off. All that does is iritate me, everytime I have to reinstall the Samsung version."
47,"Ho hai hfllgo, Logghhll j mtdf M NV g ikrmi j On gyi Ghar o nut Got üòã"
48,In if
49,"Was much better when you could select free to me/on prime. The TV selection seems to be greatly reduced and, again, all the pay to view things seem to come up first."
50,Great Content and Great Products.
51,üëç
52,you can't adjust streaming video quality on a specific video and that's very bad
53,Very bad experience as well service Almost show rental pay when already I'm already subscriber customer so why pay rental pay my favourite movie
54,Great for watching movies and TV shows
55,I could not open it up. Too many glitches
56,Love it!
57,OK cool
58,It sucks donkey d
59,Excellent movie selection
60,I wish that there were some more movies that weren't for rent or buy
61,Foreign movies caption hasn't worked forever...still doesn't work.
62,OUTSTANDING !!!!!!! 5 STAR PLUS
63,Half the channels don't work right. Starz flashes green every 30 sec. When you start videos on fire stuck or Android box always starts in audio descriptive. Subtitle never line up when another language is spoken.
64,"We have to pay for open your app and rent a movie from you again, why don't ask money for download the also"
65,I like this app!
66,I've never had a problem with the app. Works fine.
67,Love it
68,Good app. Occasionally downloads fail to play. Inability to purchase within app is extremely frustrating. Every time i open the app i need to reconfirm my cookie choices
69,"I'm not a fan of the ads, which is one of the reasons it's getting a 4 star instead of a 5. I also wish finding movies or shows you wanna watch was easier. Plus, we are already paying for prime, so having ALL, not some of the shows and movies be free, would be nice if you're a prime member."
70,"Not being able to buy things to watch through the app is ridiculous. I know why they changed it, but I don't care. Amazon removed a ton of convenience and functionality to avoid paying higher fees, yet are still charging the same or increasing subscription fees for use."
71,Great movies... but you could offer theater movies that just came out.
72,"Even with the adds, it's worth giving it a try for"
73,Wont open
74,Your app is just spining cant' uninstall app or re update. Just spins
75,Worst app ever. . I can't watch much because this app crashes OFTEN!!! daily sometimes. Considering canceling but it comes with prime
76,"I Like It, But I don't like the new look."
77,Alsome movie. I was on a roadcoaster of differant emotions.
78,Investor needed!!!!!
79,Amazing Amazon
80,I cannot see 'themed icon' native support in this app's icon. This is against the design Language of the latest android. You should fix this asap
81,The Prime Video is good. Could use some more personal improvements. On a Chromebook App the watchlist should be easier to get to.
82,great
83,Brilliant
84,If i give money.... Then i will choose Netflix or other not Amazon prime
85,It's loaded with 35 sec long adds like watching tv can't skip it's makes you feel like you are using some free Chinese app will unistall as soon as the subscription is over .
86,"All I want to do is delete this app, can someone please tell me how to remove it. Thank you."
87,"Streaming quality is poor and lags, and instead of suggesting the next episode in a series it suggests a random movie from my watch list. but i appreciate the pop out window so I can multitask."
88,Great
89,"Why, when I pay for Prime, do I have to pay AGAIN to watch some programs? Hasn't that prat Bezos got enough money?"
90,To many ads
91,It keeps hanging on my Galaxy tab A8. I have to restart to fix it.
92,"Vtteu . ..... . . ,Mmkuu a few minutes"
93,I'm not going to renew the subscription
94,"Great app, great experience, only problem I found, sometimes, it's a weird greenish flickering in between frames. Not always. Rest is amazing."
95,"Worst application, I was just logout my device and try to login again saying that i can't play video because of logged in into another device, worst application"
96,"Modi greedy company I have ever seen , Most of classic movies moved to rent ,Netflix charges almost the same amount but they don't show these cheap mindset"
97,prime video content is so limited in Pakistan why And you charge us as well other site Netflix give as so much control plz do something in Pakistan prime video content and fix it
98,üò†
99,"It's a good app but... on my mobile device it only plays the sound and not the video. I'm Uninstalling it again and see if works with the next download. 7/2/23 Update: Still no visual display on my mobile device, just sound. That sucks."
100,The app interface is very good. The description and imbd ratings and all information of any content are seamlessly embedded which makes the viewing and choosing any sort of entertainment very easy. Just a small disappointment is the subscription under subscription a request please keep other subscriptions in different niche or tab .

106,"Thre are not many options and 80% of movies only have regional audio no hindi,hindi version is available everywhere but in prime its disappointing,you should rather watch movies in YouTube"
107,"It's okay. I'm signed up for Amazon prime but still don't get free access to all the shows/movies. Guess I don't understand how it works. This is all the ""TV"" I have to watch and I pay for Amazon prime so I would think it would work better."
108,Love it!
109,That review was from a long time ago & yet this app is STILL HORRID! I'm sure Amazon can do something about this issue!! Constantly reloads- if not for Columbo I would close APP

118,App is not working in my Mibox4 after the latest update. App pause after the display of logo. Please fix.
119,"User interface nya agar lebih mudah digunakan, seperti zoom video hrs manual ga bisa pinch to zoom"
120,Prime video player like 19 century because Brightnes and sound option not available on screen... Please update the like VLC or MX video player..
121,They are charging another subscription/rent on almost all popular or new movies. Why should I pay subscription two times firstly for Amazon prime and another for watching the movie. This is really a cheap strategy and not expected from this giant company (Amazon).
122,Add option to double tap / swipe to seek 10 seconds
123,Rubbish content Very few options And area restrictions Disappointed Money wasted
124,Visual quality needs to improve
125,What your problem it is download the app and try to try again updated
126,App is good
127,Nice
128,"App asks for cookie permission every time I open it. Just don't use them, this is a horrible experience."
129,Bakwas fake they tied up with lionsgate best movies are on lions gate if you want to watch movies on Amazon prime then you have to rent or buy that movie on the platform of lionsgate means first you have to buy Amazon prime then you have to buy lionsgate subscription this is wrong better to go with lionsgate subscription üôèüèª
130,"Prime video Bahut hi achche se kaam karta hai , mujhe bahut pasand aaya"
131,Wrst app. I've paid. And still can't use it. Again asking me to recharge. Hate this app. What about my money?
132,Niceüòò
133,No dolby and 4k support for Xiaomi pad 6 ?
134,I have taken subscription but app not opening showing some bug fix in this app after updating please solve it
135,Super entertainment
136,Put every show on rent.. Harry Potter is also not spared . Why should anyone buy subscription?
137,Excellent app
138,"Cant watch my downloaded movie, because of expired subscription. Then renewed to continue the film. THEN, can no longer watch because of no subscription? B.S. Even watching online? JUST RENEWED MY SUBSCRIPTION!!! this grinds my gears..."
139,Prime video is all services good really satisfied
140,Useless
141,Dislike having to leave the app and go to Amazon to rent or buy a video/movie etc. Used to be able to purchase right from the app. And sometimes you can't find the buy option on the Amazon Home app.
142,Plz upload the latest movies
143,"I had subscribed this for 1 year, but recently i had changed my mobile, and prime video is asking me again to subscribe, what to do?"
144,"Probably have the worst interface in the world just learn from Netflix, thats why it is no.1"
145,Most movies on rent üòë
146,I love prime
147,"I have tried everything possible to contact prime and Amazon it is simply impossible. I have access to my account but it seems I have no subscription but I'm still paying my monthly account fee. I cannot cancel anything as the system registers me as a non- subscriber. Please help, I'm at the point of contacting my bank and making a complaint of fraud."
148,Worst subscription app
149,I'm an overseas subscriber. Why is it that I pay for prime in full but don't get the full benefits? I can only watch a handful of what's available. The math doesn't add up.
150,Really slow streaming. Not my end as all other streaming services work fine. Very hard to cancel subscription. Claims I'm not subscribed but still charges me.
151,Very poor search. I searched Avengers and it shows movies like Bahoobhali. No option for language filter
152,Is it that hard to add subtitle?
153,"Security check buat daftar eror, menglang terus"
154,"It was working in the beginning, but now, it's just subtitle and color black. There was no update of anything, I don't know what is wrong with it. Tried restarting my phone, everything is just black."
155,Good???
156,Everytime screen goes blank and subtitles go off!
157,Superb quality
158,I watch this all the time it brilliant and affordable
159,Some really great shows on here...but some of my favs have been removed. (Psych) so still a bit peeved about that.
160,Nice
161,Good
162,Promo code redeem kya nhi bol rhe ke apne redeem kr liya hai bad service
163,One of the best. Easy to use. Made with common sense. You don't have to look in some unrelated folder to find what you need. Video quality is excellent. No complaints so far.
164,"Keep alerting that I owe money and my payment isn't due for two weeks, yet My bank is showing when it usually withdrawals payment yet for two weeks I've been getting alerts and notifications about my membership being on hold or cancelled ."
165,üëåüòä
166,"The brightness setting of videos literally sucks. There is no option to increase brightness inside video. Even if phone brightness is full, video clarity remains the same. Low light movies watching is worst experience on Prime. Suggest to improve the same just like Netflix or other platforms do."
167,We need to rent so many good movies after having the Prime subscription so this just doesn't make sense.
168,This is worst ott app. I am unable to purchase the premium plan. The selection of country code for mobile number is not working. This app is testing users patience. Not recommended app. Worst worst worst experience at all. 2 hours time wasted with this app
169,Prime membership is not worth it. Hotstar plus Netfix is very good quality content . Your looks old black app
170,Awesome
171,No current movies just very old movies and the video quality is so low
172,"Love this app, never have had a problem with it. Let's me watch south park:)))"
173,Cannot see video
174,Why r u rent fees for any new movies üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
175,Less than optimal. Doesn't use wi-fi by default. Recommendations are hilarious
176,Unable to download any video on my one and only device. I have an annual plan of ‚Çπ599.
177,Consistently works! Great offerings.
178,Earlier the platform was really good but now a days all their best movies has been shifted to rent Store and and all the low budget movies except 2 to 3 good movies can only be seen from the subscription
179,Best ott
180,"3c2nkn3, 3ek3, che C33X 4"

198,Great to have
199,I used to love it but at the moment it's driving me nuts asking for cookie preferences every time I open it . It's fine on the TV but it's annoying on my phone.
200,"The quality of movies, why is it that my phone that has 2k screen stream in 720p even though i have 5g and high speed wifi"
201,Hugely impressive
202,This is a useless app. This app get more puzzle that why I am no given the rate to this app. So clear the login to this useless app

230,Es genial
231,8 P
232,Garbage same movies and tv shows nothing really new gets added
233,Casting requires purchases & rents. To cast you need a phone subscription $150.00-&250.00
234,to hard to navigate. not easy to find what you are looking for. Original app was good enough
235,"üí© Amazon should be embarrassed. App is buggy, clunky, missing basic features of modern streamers, terrible on android TV and intentionally lacking basic google assistant media control. Trying to promote your platform by allowin an app this pathetic to exist with your name on platforms you dislike just makes me want to avoid anything with your name on it."
236,"Your POS app keeps crashing after I de-registered a bunch of devices and re-registered my phone. Your app is so unusable at this point that I am using my phone's browser to watch my show. Your developers should be ashamed. Edit: As of around 7 PM, I can no longer use my browser to watch your content. Your service is completely inaccessible on my phone now. My subscription is going to be canceled if this isn't fixed by tomorrow."
237,Why cant i rent anything on the app anymore why do i have to go on a browser to rent then it doesnt even work
238,Your app sucks. 1 day it works fine. The next it won't stop buffering or load anything at all. Please fix this.
239,I'm amazed about this app
240,I like the movie's & series they show. Awesome Amazon prime video üçøüëç
241,Horrible. The app logged me into an account I do not use. I could not log out in order to log into the account I actually watch Prime Video with all the time. There was nowhere in the settings to switch to a different account. There was nowhere to find help.
242,The videos seems glitchy. Audio works perfect but video is not smooth. S23 plus
243,"It would be a 5, but I'm really tired of ads before every show I select. And what is with this freevee? Lots of shows that used to be included with prime are now there with ads. And lots of things with no other option to watch, except on there with ads. Plus, to add insult to injury, they won't even let you uninstall the app from fire tv! Don't you realize we dumped cable and use a fire stick to get away from the ads?"
244,Thank you
245,Amazing quality
246,"Fast, sleek good!"
247,"A couple of Algorythmic fixes and this would be perfect. 1) A) 'Next up' should adopt pre-existing viewing conditions. B) Preload the next episode start within 10 seconds of the Running of the credits. Show me a producer who doesn't own a computer, or hire a geek; and, I will show you an out of work directors assistant. 2) 'Skip Intro' and 'Skip Recap' is -Mandatory customer option- for every episode after the pilot. I'm just sayin' Just ask the directors assistants."
248,"Can't. Being able to walk around with prime tv in hand and watch when, where and how is mind blowing ü§Ø"

257,Looting money from us
258,"Please guys, improve the interface of the app!"
259,Awesome
260,Nice movie collection
261,"hard to navigate to find new movies and series. other than that, perfect"
262,The only reason I'm changing the rating down to a 3 is because a lot of movies i wanna watch even if I wanna pay for it I can't get it when I called up I get all kind of excuses for why it's not working out but never with a solution
263,Excellent

I hope they fix this issue and also the unscreen brightness and all the good movies should be paid for."
267,"Bad app experience. Video starts at a very low streaming quality and continues playing with the same in spite of high speed Internet connectivity. After playing for a while, video starts and continues to stutter unless there's a touch input on the screen."

272,Good
273,Amazon is amazing
274,Amazon paid boost & sprint to force it on us!
275,"Options for movies are pretty good, but I wish the way you search was a little easier, I had it figured out and now they changed the format."
276,Best of the best.
277,Very bad experience
278,The inside subscriptions and the rent features are the worst. Will leave as soon as someone comes up with the next available alternative.
279,Would be better if we were Able to download to Playstation Harddrive for offline use
280,just for sign up so hard. uninstall then
281,"The layout is terrible. One day, you're watching a decent series, and the next day, you have to pay to continue watching it. Brightness levels could also use improvement. Would've given 3 stars but I'm pretty irritated about being 5 episodes into a series then boom 1.99-2.99 per episode"
282,Good
283,Very nice üëç
284,Best
285,Good
286,Wonderful!!!!
287,Most of the good movies linked to another subscription
288,Wow
289,All best movies are on rent
290,It is a highly confidential app. It takes so many different kinds of problems in sing in options. That whenever you want to sign in this app and whenever you forgot your password. Then at that time this app is behave like you are a criminal and your crimes can never be forgotten. It takes so much problem and efforts to create a new password . So I request please please please make this situation simple ....... Or otherwise change its name for PRIME VIDEO TO A GARBAGE VIDEO
291,All good movies on rent after giving them rs 1500
292,I enjoy using prime video app on my phone i can watch it anywhere
293,Amazon Prime Video Quality Sucks.. Netflix Rocks ..advise to download Netflix..
294,Hate the concept of prime creators that they hv so many channels lying under the Amazon name n we hv to tk separate subscription for each channel which is truly absurd and fully unsatisfied.
295,Voice quality ia very low
296,Lnt
297,Couldn't love the variety of Amazon Prime Video anymore than I already do!!
298,Mostly good a little slope Lane at times.
299,It's better than ever before Thanks! I rate this 5 Stars.
300,Hate it
301,"All the popular movies needs some additional subscription or rent ,then what's the point of having prime subscription"
302,"Paathaa keanna koodhi maari theriyudha..., kaasa vaangitu unga vilambarama poodreenga üò°"
303,Better than Netflix imo.
304,"Features are boring, keys and navigation is not for this century"
305,It's amazing app full of entertainment
306,Good
307,üëç
308,I hate rent
309,"Great app, like the fact you can also add other services and watch some stuff free with ads. Like all the major players the offerings are quite diluted as they battle for market dominance, but it's to be expected with so many available services. My biggest gripe however is the fact that it's near useless abroad, and even the meagre pickings are not clearly offered. Netflix is a lot better when travelling. Overall though, Amazon is a game changer and worth the purchase."
310,i dont want your app. stop holding me hostage with your constant bs about how much better it would be for me. the extra benefits you claim i will get by downloading is pure rubbish. beat it with your incesent pop ups. you guys suck rocks.
311,Sir dard hai app no simple login
312,Good content...
313,It is good for those who watch lot of Indian movies. But Amazon prime in website has no resolution settings. You can not adjust resolutiaon on website. You don't have multiple divice output option on app üòï.
314,Mast
315,I love it
316,Very good..
317,Love the download watch later feature Love the sci fi selection
318,Nice app
319,Super varied entertainment
320,Ibomma is best
321,"Seems most of the shows and movies that are worth watching u have to pay extra for. To pay to watch those shows isn't easy anymore and you can't do it in the app making it more difficult. Other streaming services don't ask you to pay more for the content they advertise. I just started watching a new series that was free, five episodes in and now I have to pay to watch the rest. Thought I was already paying to use the service?"
322,Casting is too poor One should be able to cast downloaded contents without data service.
323,Very convenient
324,App is amazing and relaxing
325,Good I like
326,Too many waste of time how are you what day is it yeah you shouldn't Happy's to showing I have a hard time finding the movies and not I want I go to select and it says that I can suggest a bumble bumble
327,"App Immediately Crashes on my Tab 8+ The app works fine on my phone, but I can't run the app on my tablet. It crashes as soon as I open it. Please fix this, and I will change this review"
328,Price is so high
329,i love it
330,Panchayat season 2 bring fast
331,Wow wonderful app
332,Super Update.
333,Yyy
334,"Wrong language in trailers. The trailers have started to have dubbed Italian even though I am not in Italy, never have been and my account country has always been Denmark and the language has always been set to English. Why it has suddenly started with the Italian I don't know. Through a Google search it seems that this has happened to other users before. Though that seems to have been a few years ago. PLEASE fix it. I can't even change the language from Italian on the trailer to the original."
335,I am never able to play downloaded videos in offline mode.
336,Ye c gu vyuug
337,Nic
338,"Used to be great, but fnow orcing me to go through cookie setting every time I open the app is making me want to cancel my subscription"
339,Half the videos dont work
340,Very pathetic video playing experience in download and streaming alike. Video is too dim and dark at max brightness very very painful to watch video. No adjustment of brightness in player section. I am very disappointed with the streaming giant.
341,Not much content in the middle east region
342,Great app. Works perfectly
343,"The movie and series catalog is good, but the app itself has significant design flaws. It lacks picture-in-picture functionality and often fails to remember my last watched position on certain devices, necessitating a repetitive search for the episode and time. The share screen button is non-functional unless I open the app on my TV first. Discovering worthwhile series is challenging; occasionally, I only stumble upon great content when resorting to Google search. IMDb feature is great."
344,Okay this was my first time buying a subscription on this app and all the good movies need a second subscription?? Like we are already paying! All the Harry Potter Movies need to be rented to watch I'm not getting a subscription on this app again
345,"O. GG I will try it on Monday morning üåÑ üôÇ üôÉ üò¥ üòä and then you WILL. ,ZXXXX≈π≈πXXXXZZXXZ"
346,Casting won't work
347,"Amazon is king ""bezoz.s for galactic emperor!!!"
348,Its stuck at solve the puzzle no matter how many times i solve it
349,"Bakwasssi just spend my 1 hour to create a new account. For verification i waste half an hour then, show that my password was wrong, then something is wrong. What the hell"
350,Content is so good but few days ago video quality is down
351,Exceptional
352,Nice aps
353,Facing issue while signing in. Such an irritating and useless app.
354,Good
355,Mere pass pesa ni he free me do please
356,"Don't download this app. It is utter waste. After paying for one month, they again ask for subscriptions for some movies. Netflix is better than this. We can't watch all the unless we pay some more money. What is the use of monthly payment."
357,Why I have to rent the movies when I am paying for that already
358,"Majority of the time anything I watched had to be on my phone because the app wouldn't connect to Chromecast, no trouble with other streaming services, only prime. Adds are annoying and most of the decent content had to be purchased after the monthly cost. No thanks. Money hungry company with low quality service"
359,Worst app ever. Don't deserve even single star.
360,Bad
361,Some series and their seasons are not showing neatly the video is currently not available it's the reason and why should it be Like supernatural season 13 isn't showing! Do something if u can!
362,Good
363,King of Sony liv
364,Beautiful
365,Cool
366,Price high
367,From some days video is not playing only audio is playing.. For these we pay our valuable money to you.. Dissatisfied
368,Very nice day and time of luck for your help with your family and friends and time again later u sir and Madam is a great day
369,Best experience!!
370,Nice app but some more hindi movies wanted
371,"There's some problem with this app. Suddenly the video stops and only audio goes on and then complete blackout on the screen and then it just doesn't work, no matter how much I wait or restart the app. This effects other apps on my phone too and it doesn't get better unless I restart my phone. What's wrong? I hope you fix it soon."
372,Its so good
373,Bakvas
374,All the movies are now being rented How shall we pay this We pay for prime and then we pay again to watch movies which were released 10 yes ago..
375,Everything on rent then what the point of subscription?
376,Ye bahut ghatiya aap ho chuka ange subscription Bechte hai fir latest movie ke lie rent mangte hai rent me to Google movie me bhi dekh sakte hai jab bhi koi new movie ati to uski purani movie ka rent mangte hai .. dosto iski rating girani hogi tab kuch akal aygi inko...
377,Incredible
378,"Do not buy this membership, it only has content for telagu, mallyalam, Tamil only. There is no content for Hindi or other languages. Latest good English content is on the rent basis. So not worth buying this service."
379,Complicatet
380,"Cannot sign in, already try 21 times, too many procedure, also waiting OTP toooo long , so shame"
381,You have to open the website in order to pay for anything?! Not even on the Amazon app not there actual website?!? Who thought that was a good idea ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
382,"You cannot make a user a default on the TV the only options to edit the profile are to change the name and image, lock it or remove it. It's so time-consuming & annoying to have to go in and change the user every time I go to prime video."
383,Very badüôè
384,Superb
385,Nice you can use üòâ üëç
386,Won't stay open... Can't use at all
387,Excellent experience
388,Worst app. Every movie has to be rented or subscribed these days. Then why do they have an annual fee? And how dare they say my movie rental will expire in 30 days?
389,App works well.No mess up. Very reliable.
390,"Delete all porn movies from the platform, you people are making users mind dull"
391,Nice
392,"Difficult log in, unclear instruction. Bad app"
393,Just what I needed üòÅ
394,App and all is fine but.....WHY ARE THERE PAYED MOVIES IF I HAVE PRIME SUB ü§î
395,Worst app i ever seen waste of time
396,Exceptional
397,No job available
398,Y4
399,Choppy video playback. Checked connection. No other streaming service has this issue
