"Would be great to have some free coins from time to time, just like Webtoon does it. Also, please fix your app, it takes too long to respond after attempting to click on the stories and coin purchase section"
Love it
Thank you
Mine is not responding and it won't load even if I am online 😒 😤 😑 😐
This is a copy of toomics app. And also have less comics then toomics app.
It's a good app but it's so expensive 😭 I swear I will watch 1000 ads just lemme see the damn episode pls
Disappointed...
It was lagging and couldn't find any way to get free coin only to pay for it and it was very expensive
This app is easy to use and everything is good there are good comics and everything.But this app does not give you free points to your comic your reading.The app is mostly paying for each page episode of the comic.And for me I dont wanna drain my money but if this app is for you then good for you..👁👄👁
It has great comics but you need to have coins to go to the rest after the 3rd chapter so 4 out of 5
it was bad it would not open at all i could not even experience what was supposed to happen in the app
All thing is one thing is problem that purchase on bl please don't do thing so I will uninstall the app
I recommended everyone to not dowload this app cause it's too expensive for normal people!! 😤😤😤😤
"It is very bad app. When I was trying to read episodes, it didn't open. I am very disappointed."
"first of all when i download this app , its so amazing 😊👍✨"
"This app isn't working well at all, you click and it dosen't respond."
"The translation (+SFX) is really excellent, however names translation is the poorest of all. Really liked the app but please fix your name translation, if possible."
Coins to read?
Everything is good but how about alternative ways to get coins without purchase it??
The app works really slow
5 star i think i will patient waiting it but the comics are good!!5 star💙
Why not use monthy subscription insted of you pay for every chapter. Not worth a whole pay check.
"Why there is no Khmer translation, I also mail it, but it is very difficult"
Not bad but every comics need a coins to read it •~•
You put the manga with different name and want me coins for that.not deserve
I hate that it has only that u watch 3 episodes and the u should buy to watch the other episodes...(sorry for my gramar)
One star because it is for mony
Ok so this app is pretty good. I like the comics I've read so far but can you possibly find some way in not having to buy the coins please
At first there was no response when I clicked anywhere. So deleted the app and downloaded again. Now everything loads very slow after clicking :/
Is it just me or the app keeps loading like there's a circulating circle laoding in the middle and when i try to browse through the comics whether it's tap to the section and scrolling through it it will go reset or go to the top as if it's keep refreshing without any reason it's annoying :/
Please add Arabic ⁦⁦(༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ)⁩
"The app takes ages to open the story, it freezes and there's not much content"
"I well like if it have maybe ""free add"" to have a Coin cause it's hard to get money this year"
That is Good. We can use it easy.I like this application. 😘☺😊😇
"I recently changed my mobile phone. but when login to my acc with my new phone, all my coins and purchased eps are lost. I have subscribed and buy coins several times. but now my purchase history and my coin usage history also gone including all the remaining of my coins. and i have purchased the silent concubine up until ep 92 and now its all gone. I have to repurchase to re-read my purchased eps? and now i have purchase coins again to continue reading? please fix this!"
"Comics are good, when they actually load. Otherwise don't waste your money on staring at a blank screen"
Won't let me sign in to existing account or purchase coins takes me to the purchase coin window but when I click to buy nothing happens tried multiple times
Worst app ever never download
"Something is off with the app. I tap on comics, but it doesn't take me to the next page. It's frozen on the Home page."
Bad app. Very expensive. No daily rewards very Very bad app
"It's a good app though, but I can't read some of the episode if I don't have coins and that's very disappointing. Please fix this.."
The storys seems great but you pretty much have to spent like £20+ to even finish reading any of them. I will he returning back to manta who has a subscription option which isn't extortionate like this app. Don't bother
"This app is trash. Why? You ask. After reading, like 2 to 3 chapters of a comic you will have to pay with coins and the coins are with money. Also as soon as you download the app you have no guide to help you around which is horrible service like a 1 star hotel. I advise you readers who read on this app to not waste your money on this and go to Google and search up your comic that you want to read."
Please can you kindly reduce the coins to 1 don't look at the fact that it is too small when you reduce the price you will gain a lot of readers and when it happens you will see that the money you make will be alot different from the 3 coins per one chapter I hope you go through my comment and think about it
Honestly I really want to have another way where I can get coins....
I love this app so much and I really love read the sweet bite mark but I give it 4 star because i can't read 5 to 186 because I don't have any coins I'm in beautiful part but I can't read😩😭😭😭😭
Well just good
Who a to hite mission best white to...
The app is wonderful I just wish we didn't have to buy coins all the time. Instead we could wait like 4 or 6 hours to unlock the next chapter. Because if the next chapter is really good time or not I'm using my coins. However it will get more people to read the comics.😇😊
I really wish there was another option instead of buying coins I would love that and if you do put that option in I will give it 5 stars
"Every time I want to read the manga, it won't open. Please fix the bug"
Can be expensive after a bit but good.
As many different things to read and entertain myself but it's one of those apps right forces you to either only read two of every comic or whatever or you are forced to use money to read the rest it's really why I don't like it pretty much the only reason cuz you're forced to spend money to actually read most of them and I'm just not the kind of guy would waste his money
I've downloaded this app 2 times because I thought that maybe it would fix the problem but everytime I downloaded it and tried to sign in with my FB account it wouldn't let me. But I can do that if I go through their FB page.
"Good luck with reading anything, there are virtually NO descriptions on the manga. What kind of story is this? Who knows! It's a mystery! A frustrating mystery."
This app seems unstable. Keep crashing everytime I try to view the comics.
"I can't sign in or sign up using Google, this doesn't work 🙄🙄"
Takes your money but never gives you the coins to read comics. No way to contact customer services.
Was able to fix the payment system. Good comics on site tho. Some not available on other services. Some from toomics but alot of new ones.
This game is great compared to other comic apps I have used before. It isn't so bad and it doesn't have that much in-app purchases and it's quite fast.I highly recommend lalatoon (this app) so dont bother looking at other reviews just scroll up and press the green button with I.N.S.T.A.L.L on it!
"This ap is not for me, but you should check it out for yourself"
Please add unlimited access or add that we can read some free comics otherwise the app is good and stories are good too
I like thise app the best
"Can't open the app,even when open can't load the comic"
I love this comic because the stories are amzing and a pro. The words makes sence. They are just amazing.
I hate it can you please please please please please please do a free coin please please and thank you
"I miss the ""Premium"" part.Ths stories looks promising and the app layout too but I have no money to read it.I suggest using ads a replacement."
It won't let me sign in
Mine just wont work it keeps lagging out and just black screen while repeating the same line
"All of the comics i want to read you have to pay for.. Like, you cant even get that much into it due to this and theres no other way to get coins aside from buying them. A lot of apps do this and its stupid"
Not enough to read and not all are free to read
Never download this app..it is gross bcz it cost so much to unlock the chapters....We are students and we can't afford such offers to read.....i think i will never recommend this....first the quality of pictures is not that good and then the cost of coins are really high like for Rs460=80 coins only...But in apps like mangatoon and webcomics you can get the chapters either by watching videos or by getting free all comics for one or three days....so i will say again never download this app
