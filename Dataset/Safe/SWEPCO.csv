If you rent a property and the service is registered in the owners name trying to get info on service during a outage is no good. Seems like to them you're none existant
Made a new account. Can log into the website with the account. Cannot log into the app with the account. Brilliant.
Only works with WiFi. App will not load using my phone's data..says it lost connection when it hasn't.data working fine with all other apps on my phone except this one.. FIX THIS BUG!
Electric is out it popped really loud at my electric pole. Transformer on my pole Please tell me when it will be back on my
"App sucks, can't log in says user ID or password wrong. I can use the same login on the web page and it works. Waste of space on my phone."
Bad suggestion
Very Helpful Will a positive attitude in great customer service and very knowledgeable thank you
"Awesome,"
"I have had the swepco app for 2 years, I've never had a bad experience while having the app I would recommend this app to people it's easy to pay your bill and report outages etc.,"

This app makes it easier to pay my bill
Very Convenient
"Not so much the app as the company. If you have other options for energy, take that other option. Swepco isn't worth the trouble. If you like throwing money to a company who will shut things off without verifying the address they're meant to be at, and then offer no help when you've been wrongly shut off, these fine people are for you! I've had an active account with them for a single month and am already getting shafted due to their employees mistakes."
i don't like the swepco app in general
Great app for managing your electric bill. Very easy to maneuver through the page.
Good
Awesome
Dose every one else see these sorry rip off people only respond to those that give them five stars and a good coment. That alone tells you how awful these people are. Not to mention the app is pure junk i would rather have tools to work with on paying these rip offs but the app is to only help there sorry butts locate a outage

Not bad
"According to this app, My password is never correct. Each time I get ready to pay I change to a new password, only to find out that one is not incorrect. Well the app wins, I am done."
slm
"My husband and I have had them for 5 years. The electric goes out 6-7 a year & takes 8-10 hrs to come on. Swepco knows we have health issues so we leave and go to Walmart. The prices are higher than other electric companies, they don't offer sun ray's for your home, or discounts for seniors. A lot of people are moving to choose another electric company, because we don't get a choice."
"Been using the app for about 6 months now and so far so good. It's a self explanatory app, just log in and you can see your monthly bill statement just like you would if you do paper bills."
Won't let me log-in
Convenient
Still need help.
Great energy supplier also great customer service
Make payments very easy. Paperless
App never works
"Never works now, please fix for 5 stars"
Wont let me log in
It never is never working right It's always telling me that it can't connect to a secure network
App won't let me login.
Won't even open anymore. Have to go through browser to pay my bill.
Everytime i open the app it ALWAYS says oops something went wrong on our end
Has not worked for months.
A lot of times I try opening it it'll say oops sorry
Hard to pay a bill when the app won't load.
This app is garbage!!!!!!! It doesn't work properly even when WiFi is on..... Fix this app
Make my bill paying and getting answer's about my power problem
This app works great!
I like it but sometimes when i open it It shows a error message and wont open
Excellent
For the past few months the app will not even work. I am guessing they are not even trying to fix the problem either. Uninstalled it!
It won't even let me log in on the app I have to go to the browser.
The app works sometimes n sometimes it dontüòï
Always has a problem on apps end
Am not able to reset password after 22 tries. Very frustrating!
The app is garbage The app will not work unless I am connected to wifi and at that point it takes a dozen clicks to attempt to just open it. Swepco wants everyone on paperless billing with a garbage app so it's nearly impossible to make a payment from the app. These apps are allegedly to make life easier. I'm frustrated I can not change cards on file either. Really cool since. Y'all are only power company in town. Well my hopes are deregulation to knock you down a few pegs.
"Idk what happened. I need to pay my bill, it keeps saying, ""something went wrong on your end"". And it wont work when I click retry or restart the app."
Before it went down I love this app as far as what all I could do as far as my electric bill goes. It was easy and made my tasks easier. NOW I have to google the phone number if something is wrong or if my electric goes out. JUST FIX THE APP PLEASE!!!
"Same as everyone else, worked great till the last update... ""oops something went wrong on our end"" please fix SWEPCO!"
Does not work.
Impossible to use.
I love having you electricity and I expect nothing in return for this grandiose comment wepco energy is the bee's knees can't get any better power than Swepco power Energy Efficiency with economical depletion what else could you ask for a a power company except for maybe renewable energy spending money that's being spent on lobbyists on research for better types of renewable energy it's all right though I plan it is beyond repair I guess I should expect my power to go off sometime soon
"Something has happened in the past few months and the app is not working well at all. It always says ""something is wrong on our end."" I loved the app before. It was so convenient and I always used it to pay my bill, etc. Please try to get it back again. It was such a good app before."
"For 2 months this app has been broken. You can't even log in, much less pay a bill. It was great before that, but definitely not happy with it now!"
It says something is wrong on Their end as soon as I open it for past month.
not working
The last 2 months or so I've had to pay my bill from desktop because the app is saying something went wrong! Please fix this
Website doesn't work correctly always says oops something is wrong
Terrible! With every update it gets worse and worse. When app actually opens/works it shocks you. It always says something went wrong on our end. Well duh!
Terrible. Almost never accepts my password or fingerprint login. Always says it's something on their end. I wish they would remedy this problem. It's frustrating!
Why every time I open the app I have to update it
We shouldnt be updating this app that often
"Use to love being able to pay my bill without dealing with customer service, but it never works anymore. Always says ""Oops something went wrong """
Cant ever get it to work right
"I cant do anything...""oops something went wrong on our end"" it worked great when I first downloaded it now it sucks."
I haven't been able to access this app in 2 mths. Tried everything and still says something went wrong on our end. What's the point of the app if you cant access your account?
It is very convenient
Very conveinent
Can't log in!
"I can access it half of the time . It has an ""oops something went wrong"" and the option to dismiss or retry but it doesn't matter which option you choose, results are the same. You cant access it."
Easy to pull up. Current with information.
Ok
It keeps saying there is an err on your side.
"The app is broken. I've updated it & it doesnt work. It says ""something went wrong on our end"". I even deleted the app & redownloaded it & its still a broken mess. Its very annoying that i have to go to the actual website to pay my bill or report outages. The whole point of the app was the convenience of not having to do that"
App no longer works
That so called new update messed up the login to where I can't login using my fingerprint.
Horrible update..can not make payments without being bumped out of program. Reinstalled App with same issue. FIX IT! I have done ALL the typical fixes and still no difference.
So refreshing.. Easier to maneuver n get matters done.
üëç
I absolutely love the convenience of this app.
Great app... Super easy to use and understand my bill. Also t like that you cab report outages and track the progress. Awesome üëç

Great
It would be better if I could schedule payments
Very easy to use and pay your electric bill... Awesome.
Pretty easy and seamless. üòä
"I love to pay my electric bill by phone. Helped me greatly. Thank you, Swepco."
Like it
Easy to use
"App has a user friendly GUI and the functions work perfectly. My only issue is, why have a debit payment option in the app if it just goes back to the website? That defeats the purpose of the app."
This app is not working...hate it.
I like
This app is useless! Absolutely cannot get it to log in! I have reset abd reset password.
