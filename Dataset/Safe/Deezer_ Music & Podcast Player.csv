0,App is great but it keep stopping randomly which at first wasn't a big deal but now its gotten annoying and more frequent.
1,"FLIPPING LOVE DEEZER. Didn't like Spotify, Pandora etc..... 100ü§åü§åDEEEZERR"
2,Great streaming service. But please... don't use video advertising!!
3,"1. App randomly stops playing in the middle of the song. 2. App randomly starts playing last song, sometimes in the middle of the night when the phone hasn't been touched for few hours."
4,"works well. occasionally crashes. song catcher hasn't worked for ages, use Google search instead."
5,"Got very expensive for Kazakhstan. It was $3.75/per month, now it is $10.99"
6,"Only paid version in Ecuador, solo hay versi√≥n de pago..."
7,"Good app, but currently glitched - albums not showing when viewing an artist."
8,You can't ALWAYS get your music
9,Ok so far but if I don't get connected I can't download nething
10,Great choice and good enough quality for an oldie!
11,excellent
12,"Used to be great app, but now it constantly changes songs order in my playlists. Often plays songs in reverse order (1st song in playlist becomes last and music stops after the song end). It's extremely annoying and at this point makes me wanna cry"
13,It's been a couple of years I am paying the subscription. Weird playback and auth bugs popping out of nowhere all this time. Loose customer support. The dev team seems to be somewhere else. I am kinda surprised of a such a relatively high rating for such a buggy app.
14,Sha 3488_&$ (8;((
15,Joined the beta program and it wouldn't let me log in at all. So tried to leave and had to uninstall the beta version of the app and reinstall the public version. Have now lost all of my downloads that I've accumulated over years.
16,way better than Amazon music!
17,I Really Love That I Can Listen To Whatever I Want Old And New. And I Also Love The Fact That I Can Listen To Deezer While I'm Driving At Night Without Having The Screen On My Phone Distracting Me While I'm Driving. And So Much Awesome MUSIC. THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR AWESOME HARD WORK YOU DO TO GIVE ALL US IN THIS WORLD GOOD ENTERTAINMENT. ITS OUT OF THIS GALAXIE GOOD. AND IM FORSURE MY ALIEN FRIENDS ARE PICKING SOME AMAZING üôÉüòÉü§´üëΩüõ∏ü™êüå†üåå
18,This sucks like why is it not available in my country
19,"Great sounding audio, but am I really getting what I'm paying for? I pay for HiFi, but there is no way to tell what the bit rate it Kbps is of the songs playing! This also collects data not relevant to provide use services. Protect your data people!"
20,Coolness
21,I love this app. I am able to listen to golden oldies I had almost forgotten about and have heard some fantastic new rock that would have never been aired where I live. Sadly I am no longer able to listen to the free version of this app as it is no longer available in the country I live in.
22,Awesome
23,I have been using Deezer for years now and I have enjoyed it i need music to focus calm down and manage stuff durin the day and Deezer has managed to get the job done and I haven't encountered any bugs üêõ but some other people have do maybe it depends
24,Doesn't have lyrics for everything but good app. Wish there was an inbetween plan though because in order to use the app on multiple devices you have to have the family plan which is for 5 people and I just don't need that.
25,Average.
26,good
27,App doesn't work stuck in offline mode so cant search anything RUBBISH!!
28,Personalized songs that hit for monent
29,pretty cool
30,GREAT APP
31,Not login or sign up
32,So far so good. (Premium account)
33,It's bad
34,If you live in America your payment will probably be declined so they can upcharge you on the new yearly rate. Why not just inform me? That sucks.
35,Love the app and great choice in music but could really use an watch app like Spotify and YouTube music
36,Llp
37,"In the past few months, song catcher has become next to useless."
38,SONG CAPTURE NO LONGER WORKING I have uninstalled the app an installed again still no joy.
39,Absolutely fantastic thanks
40,Please i cant subscribe when i log in my account details...
41,One of the only places to get hi-fi but the app is not stable and sucks for music exploration everytime i play an artist its the exact same songs i have to look up specific songs practicly to use. For example of stability the songs will stop playing and has error retreiving data they really need to hire better stability testers and adopt some sort of song exploration algorythm
42,the best
43,Love how it changes volume from making a call to playing a game
44,Was working fine till 5 days ago... the app just broke üíî down try and get it fixed
45,"Excellent music streaming service. All my music dreams came true. I am satisfied with HiFi sound. Playlists are excellent, the best in class. Please develop something like Spotify connect or have better integration and better search options for Yamaha and Bluesound because not all features are available. Sometimes it is impossible to fave an album or playlist in mobile app. In the desktop app please put all albums in the beginning of discography, not some of them in the end after featured in."
46,Good app
47,"Muy mal , pague en mercado libre y no puedo entrar a mi cuenta."
48,Deezer: Music & Po... Rate this app Wynn wong Review are public and include your account and device info Learn more
49,I can't even sign in to my account.
50,"After having deezer premium for 10 years switching to a Spotify due to a problems with constantly pausing music, and closing app. Invested a lot of time in communicating issues with Deezer suport but no soluton that would work out, came out of it. Heard same experience from IT guys around and got advised to switch to a Spotify. Also had an issues with braking in app, changed all the passwords i used but still happened."
51,Always plays remixed versions of the songs I ask for awful and certainly not what I pay for time to move on to a different service
52,"This app used to work good I had the free version, I did not have any complaints, however, some advertising started bursting in so laudy forcing me to put the volume down for 30 seconds which is annoying specially when I work."
53,"Baddest shiz everywhere I go! The shiznet massively! The One! Rock the ffffoorever out...no interruption, pausing,best quality music anywhere, honestly!"
54,"Overpriced, many missing tracks with the paid version. Awful user interface. If I select a band, it'll play the same song several times and never play the classic hits , plus will randomly insert unknown bands into the playlist. After cancelling, the free version is barely functional with the added insult of an ad after every song. Uninstalling."
55,"Ads have gone through the roof, and you force us to hear about the lgbdqabdzqr every 5 minutes. Don't download!"
56,Been using Deezer for a couple years. High quality music and user friendly.
57,"Its very bad honestly, my experiences with the app are mostly awful. Poor design choices, long loading time, stupid search engine, lack of customer supports. And last but not least , the ""Hi-fi"" support on Smart TV (not android TV which has built in chrome cast and stuff),for example Sony TVs and Samsung TVs. They are super annoying cause i spent tons of money on the high end speaker setup and the TV just to listen to some 160kbps??. Unreal"
58,"I've been an annual paying customer of Deezer for 3 years. Everything works perfectly, never had an issue, don't understand why people are complaining, especially the free users. What I love most is the user interface. It's simple & works like a dream"
59,love the mix playlists way better variety then Spotify
60,great music
61,"I was hoping to replace Amazon music but I keep selecting Bob Seger Turn The Page and it tells me unable to load page, an error has occurred."
62,haven't experienced any problems good music app so far
63,I like music over
64,Let me login in my account
65,Si on est premium √ßa change bcp de choses mais pas premium on a aussi une bonne exp√©rience je recommende cette apli üòäüòÄ
66,Please add unlimited playlist size. It's time.
67,"Fix your app..... every time I go back online, I get random foreign music I have never listened to in my playlist!!!!! Once you fix it so that never happens then you may have a 5 star rating"
68,"Cannot log in since the latest update - I keep getting a ""It is currently impossible to sign up to deezer in your country"", despite: - Deezer being available in my country - This account already exists, so there's no need to sign up."
69,Info from account on here ended up on the dark web. Not cool. Just discovered it's been there since 2019. Hope there isn't any damage. Workin on resolving now. Any help you can provide? I got the app for my new truck to play music. Didn't work so I didn't use it. Probably still have the app on an old phone. Very disappointing cause had high hopes for my new truck audio
70,Great
71,best if you want hifi audio!
72,the interface could be easier to navigate
73,"a wonderful app, in other words the best that I've used ‚ô°‚ô°"
74,I've been using it for 8 yrs now along several countries and the 90% of the time I have availability of the most part of the music I'm looking for.
75,the shuffle is very consistent. Flow provided too many already favorited songs.
76,Wow
77,–ù–∞–±–∏—ò–µ–º –Ω–∞ –∫—É—Ä–∞—Ü —Ü–µ–æ –î–∏–∑–µ—Ä —Ç–∏–º.
78,The app stops working at times. And after taking a call the music also just keeps on stopping. I'm only sticking with Deezer because it will be a hassle to re download all of my music again. Would rather have gone to Spotify
79,Such good music recommendations. Love it. LOVE the music quizzes!
80,Ita your loss again DEEZER !
81,Very bad üëé üòï
82,Im not paying 10.99 a month to listen to full albums. Only lets you hear maybe 2 tracks then have to lsiten to over 2 minutes of advertisments. So its bye bye app. Unless you can afford 10.99 a month dont bother with this app
83,"Good enough for getting off the Apple Music hamster wheel. However, app keeps stopping, crashing after 20 to 30 minutes. Very annoying, as I do work that requires intense focus for long stretches and would like my flow to not get interrupted by sudden silence. Also, #Deezer gives no info on albums or artists beyond the basics. Would have been nice to have similar level of information as on Apple music. It at least a link to online info elsewhere."
84,"Used to lo e this app but like every other business they got greedy and started charging for ad free music, can't you do anything for the people, but money will always be companies preference"
85,Still having issues with deezer. Rather switch back to Spotify since they don't give me issues like deezer does. Can't press next on the lock screen when I'm listening via Chromecast. I literally have to go and unlock my phone and press next. Plus the music selection isn't the best. It doesn't play what I'm looking for.
86,"The same as any music app, just waaaay less popular. Less custom playlists. What I dislike the most is that it's not fast to load and open, at least not as fast as something like YouTube Music. Also they advertise a higher quality but I just can't perceive it. Maybe because I'm not an audiophile - but if I can't, the average listener probably won't either."
87,Best sound quality ever plattform
88,pays
89,to many times stop working and turns off
90,Love the freedom and options. Good music app. I've used a thousand different ones and this covers them all.
91,The customer service is rubbish
92,Getting seriously unhappy with more and more songs getting suddenly not available in my country. Why is Deezer doing this? Considering switching to Spotify.
93,got my body in awesome shapeü§û (long story ‚ù£ü§ô)
94,Deezer is not available free.
95,the Best music player. I've really enjoyed
96,Awesome!!!
97,"I was using deezer for last few years and last 2 weeks is constantly stopping-completely crashing down. Aside of that, every 4th song or so which i have downloaded cannot play so i repair it, works for few times and than again. Pls fix it, i dont pay this app for crashing and not playing!!!"
98,it's incredible. i have passed my best night. c'√©tait g√©nial
99,App exceeds expectations
100,"I have tried to contact the developers, sent them an email a week ago and haven't received any response yet. I am going to cancel the subscription that I have and uninstall the app."
101,"thanks again for share all that magic of music, and be part of us thanks really appreciate it... you're gays (Deezer) are awesome üòéüëç... be good Deezer are number one..."
102,Perfect music app!
103,I like Listening to Music and I have my fav song is Symphony
104,"Why not the possibility by style, year or country?"
105,Best sound quality with HiFi option.
106,Terrible app. Forced me to make an account just to use the song analyse feature and then IT DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE SONG. Waste of time entirely.
107,This is nice app I can download music in office that's amazing
108,Perfect
109,"I like it. it's simple, it's easy to use, and it gives me easy access to the music I enjoy. I'll give it five stars."
110,This is not cool everyone that has this app check it your info is part of the data breach because mine is I need someone that work for this app to connected me know or else I'm suinüëéüëéüëé
111,what a trip!
112,So many bugs its crazy. Maybe it was good before but for last year it is terrible. Just avoid it. I used it for 1 year and I will now try with spotify
113,better then Spotify
114,Quite happy with my Deezer experience for over 5yrs now..however the app randomly stops when there is full wifi and cell dara signal available. Could you check in to that? Cheers
115,it's worth the month no ads at all
116,Worth a try. When it finds a tune that sounds nothing like the original how do I delete this?
117,Thought this was free
118,highly recommend!
119,The sound level is too high and leads to clipping unless normalisation is turned on! This is a serious flaw. Recommendations algorithm is behind the competititors. All else is great.
120,Nice app
121,"Easy to use and can find just about whichever song I want. One downside, I had been paying for premium for a year and close to the year it started glitching like mf and kept telling me there was an error with playback after just one song. Edit: it's been a year since I ended my sub, and the random ending of playback has continued/gotten worse and now there's an after every bloody song. Bet Imma start looking at other platforms."
122,Uninstall
123,"Now that is not free access for mexico anymore, it's completely useless, I was looking forward to pay subscribtion again, when possible, but it's discouraging, with this, I rather don't pay and look for a more friendly service, and I don't want apologies or excuses, it was good while it lasted."
124,Too much space
125,I wish i could sync podcasts with other apps. Also impossible to add podcast episode to playlist or queue
126,false info
127,This app is just so cool despite its existing challenges
128,"Deezer is so awesome - just straight foward and I can find any song I think of any time! LOVE Deezer, best music app I've ever used!! Thanks"
129,I've had all the other music apps. And they don't compare to deezer!! Deezer has a lot of music that the other apps don't.
130,Gr8
131,"Still having occasional issues, but overall STILL LOVE MY DEEZER!!!"
132,Suddenly free version not available in my country.
133,This app is full of propaganda and they are always trying to sell me something
134,Bro you can not play offline
135,I love the quality of the audio
136,"That's sad. If it was 3 euros, not 7. Would be fine."
137,Insane
138,Awesome ü§©ü§©
139,I love it!!!still
140,otimo
141,Niiiiiccceee!!!
142,Hope it's good
143,DEEZ NUTS (I recommend deezer tho )
144,"Has a good selection of music, all functionality I care about is available through the app, the search function works well, and overall it just does what it's supposed to. Great app!"
145,Tell you after trying
146,"Used to work just fine on my OnePlus, but ever since I switched to Pixel 7 this app has been disastrous. I have to manually turn on the equalizer every time I open the app, and every time I skip a song or play a new song. And sometimes the equalizer doesn't even work. If it helps, I connect my phone to Bluetooth speakers. But this has been the case across multiple speakers and wired headphones."
147,helli radio üìª
148,"With the occasional bug or two, this app is in my opinion, the only competitior to spotify. Nothing else comes close. Deezer has all the music spotify has, the features are all there, but on top of that, you get to benefit your artists more."
149,"doesn't work, subscribed for premium but cannot save any songs, trying to cancel now"
150,Always loved Deezer and always will. Great update on new music and affordable package options
151,"Ad after every song. The music found is good, but I hear an ad & I just quit listening next thing it's the middle of a song"
152,"1000000 times better than spotify here its almost unlimited music tracks and no much ads , and deezer doesnt add some songs that i might like"
153,very bad
154,You better really like bon jovi if you're gonna download this app
155,Great app! Has everything if not more than Spotify.
156,The sound quality is simply the best!
157,"Excelente, pero le faltan detalles; por ejemplo no puedes usar el telefono como control mientras reproduces en otro dispositivo."
158,Dope
159,"used to be great. but lately, proper glitches. doubt it will improve. & the song catcher feature (which used to be brilliant) is now utter garbage, i am absolutely fed up with the words ""something went wrong"" when trying to use it. There is NOTHING WRONG with my Internet/wifi connection!!!....but everything is completely wrong with that particular feature."
160,Awful personalization in Flow. They will force you to listen what they want you to listen. Your opinion on this doesn't matter.
161,Super mjuz
162,"App slowly and increasingly starts to bug and freeze over 2-month periods, I have resorted to reinstalling the app completely on a semi-regular basis. The new features of track numbering and extreme rounded corners are unnecessary."
163,"Hi Deezer, I don't why your app is no longer responding after updating it and paying for subscription. Please fix it"
164,De la pub m√™me dans la version payante (recommandation sponsoris√©e)..... En plus du fait que l'application a du mal a lire des titres t√©l√©charg√©s dans la plus haute qualit√© lorsque la connexion wifi est instable...
165,Well app
166,"App is now stopping in the middle of songs. On top of an only ok user experience, this makes it unusable for me."
167,I tried to download it on my Galaxy watch 5 then it said I have to download the app on my phone so I did that then it went back to my watch and it said I can't do anything unless I pay for a subscription lol a subscription for what I already own my own music I'm not paying a subscription to play my own music which I already purchased and I already own you dumbass
168,Seigo
169,"I use to like this app USE TO, I paid for a subscription to deezer hi fi and get to I only have a free subscription, then go check my bank account and see that I've been charged not once but 4 times in one day, don't even bother with this company, I'm going back to using pandora and xm, I'm in contact with my bank about these charges, years ago they were great now they blatantly are stealing money and ripping people off."
170,"great selection of music ,just pick an artist , listen and like ‚ô•Ô∏è and it's stored too your playlist . if you are like me and love my music pay the $ 12 a month, it's so worth it . thank you deezer for great sounds and good vibes üëç"
171,"It doesn't allow me to have a free account because of my region, I don't recommend this app if wanna listen to music"
172,This app closes at random times even on a galaxy S23 ultra multiple times a day sometimes even within the same song multiple times. Get Spotify. Been using deezer for over 5 years now and this last two years made me regret ever signing up.
173,It's actually great I like it. I also recommend other people to install the app
174,I used to be able to use the 'Whats this song' to identify songs from other apps while minimizing Deezer. It no longer works. It was such a useful feature and now not anymore.
175,I love it!
176,This app is data leak app. Be careful where you install it. you could be sure than your password will be sold to hacking websites! terrible experience.
177,App removes your playlist alot as if youv'e never had any playlist created. Extremley infuriating. App comes out of France. Dont waste your money. I had this app for years. Now they think they have you by the hair.why dont they send upcoming notice for payment instead of removing your music..üò† Deezer doesnt give a damn about its clients!! üñï
178,L'ordre des chansons en favorites ne fait que s'inverser.
179,"Doesn't detect available wifi speaker. Spotify does it, not deezer. Fix it. (e. g. Sonos WiFi Speaker)"
180,"Its a decent app with a good selection of music, but the edit function ig your playlist keeps moving songs i havent even touched and messes up my Playlist. It also stops the music for no reson sometimes."
181,Very nice app Some very nice music love it.
182,ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿ¢
183,"Me gusta mucho la app, solo que a veces se bugea moment√°neamente cuando hago cambio de red"
184,"Terrible terrible Terrible, and can't uninistall it, without coming bk to play store, I would of just unistalled and forgot it. As I had to come into play sore, I decided to leave a bad review"
185,"Excellent music app, it's got a few bugs like everything else. My main issue with it is not being able to disable the ""Flow"" algorithm on the mobile app. World be nice to have an on/off switch for Flow. The algorithm works well at times but at times I'd like to navigate manual on the mobile app Other than that works better then expected! Good job üëçüëç"
186,The search functionality is terrible. Every other part of the app is great. But the performance time if the search is so frustrating. It can take many minutes just to search for one song! And even when the internet connection is very strong too
187,This app constantly amazes me I'm sixty one my first 45 was the Lola by the Kinks when it was released my first album was Donovan's greatest hits which was my first introduction to the two most requested studio musicians at the time John Paul Jones and a guy named Jimmy Page so clicking the heart button on my first music I owned and letting the app's analytics suggest playlists within weeks with my heart selections it pretty much flowed right into my actual music listening experience
188,Awesome App
189,Happy
190,"On the Chrome app, it just stops playing in the middle of a playlist. Like, there is no consistency with when it will stop playing. It just turns itself off randomly. It is very annoying."
191,‚ù§Ô∏èdeezer!
192,love it
193,"I discovered this app over 6 months ago, and now music and so many great audiobooks are filling my days."
194,"If you don't pay for premium have fun with ads that are overly loud and lock the app till they finish. One of the main reasons I'll be leaving this app is that it won't allow you to listen to an album all the way through, all you'll get is 2 songs in before it starts playing songs from other random artists without no way of going back to the original artists album."
195,great damn sounds!!!
196,Fhj
197,who pays for a podcast player? lame af
198,top notch
199,What is the point of a premium subscription when the app still bothers me with product placements and popups? üò° Contact support? Seriously?! Support can't help in this. -1 ‚≠ê
200,What happened to the sleep timer? It's still in the description but not on the app?
201,The album art looks pixilated I'm using S23 ultra
202,using it for years. best music app!!!!
203,The site leaks passwords
204,"love it, use it daily"
205,"Please stop having the app sign users out when it's updated, thanks."
206,Giga Chad only ‚úã
207,"Je suis un gros consommateur de musique et j'utilise Deezer depuis plus de 10 ans. Malheureusement, je trouve les limitations de morceaux, albums etc trop restrictives. Cela fait quelques ann√©es que j'adapte mon utilisation de l'appli √† ces limites alors qu'√† mon sens, un service payant devrait s'adapter √† mon besoin. Je l'ai indiqu√© plusieurs fois au support. Exemple: +1000 albums qui font compl√®tement planter mon application Android. J'envisage √† pr√©sent de changer de service de streaming..."
208,Don't download it üí©
209,I love Deezer i just wish the songs would stop stopping and freezing.
210,"The app is okay, a bit more clunky than its competition, but it does what it must do. Please remove the constant Waze plugging advertising. I have Waze, I use it, I don't need your reminder to do so, especially if I pay to have no ads."
211,It is hard to play music offline especially at areas with poor network... Please please pleeeaaaseeee fix that
212,Good application Loveit
213,It is not available in Pakistan
214,My favorite music is on there all that app I love deeply so. Much
215,Just good music! Easy app to work with.
216,"Its an extraordinary app,I just love it"
217,I love Deezer!
218,Stream stops and starts about every minute or so. It's very annoying. Should not have paid for premium
219,"Great app overall. However, the loop function has stopped working. It will play a song twice, and then go to the next song despite me having the one-song loop activated. I go and check the song page, and the loop function is turned off by the second time the song plays. Perhaps a bug?"
220,Dont download this application as it sells users profile and passwords in people who can use it for wrong purposes So bewaree! I have downloaded it and seen it myself.
221,"This app is trying to get access of your personal information from Google or whatever is in cooperation with others. If you deny it, easily no more use of this app. I don't suggest it anymore to people."
222,"Everything works perfectly, except loading times. Otherwise would've been 5 stars Edit: Was amazing when they offered a free plan in South Africa. Same price as Spotify, Spotify works much better"
223,i must pay before i browse your app?? why did y'all ruin deezer for Nigeria?
224,Price is high in the middle east so i am using Anghami as an alternative.. although Deezer is better.
225,App is amazing but for some reason every 30min to an hour the app just shuts off really a bother when you're driving. Other than that 1 glitch it's the perfect app. Music is always out on time everytime
226,Best application everüíú
227,cant control other devices like with Spotify. fix that and will give 5‚òÜ
228,"had trouble downloading podcasts, otherwise it's good"
229,no add to queue or play next option
230,really loving Deezer Great Lossless audio quality. üòé
231,A potential competitor for Spotify that deserves a shot
232,try to add more music
233,No free version in my country. So in order to access my previous history I have to subscribe to premium with which I won't do. I'm with Spotify. You've literally destroyed your entire brand by moving away from the free tiers. Won't be back. Made the best decision it appears.
234,"I made a review a few months ago for Deezer which was about the ads but now it's about the playlists. I can't even listen to my music. I want to listen to a playlist but when I hit shuffle play, it comes up with songs that don't exist in my playlist immediately! Just let me listen to my own music! I used to have Deezer Premium too which was expensive to say the least so I may not be getting it again."
235,Happy and smiling
236,This app sucks they really push getting the premium account with video ads and the increasing number of advertisers including the ad for premium it constantly kicks me out for no reason it doesn't give me a reason why it kicked out so I can't screenshot anything and no I'm not going send you a email it's about time to look for a better music app
237,Emily Barker is fantastic . Watch out for UK gigs
238,hi can you please add an update with my favorite song Alexander Stan all my people please
239,So I used to think the app was awesome but over the years its getting progressively worse. Its all small usuability issues that are never addressed. The downloaded music page constantly refreshes when you go into it. You loose your spot and there is always a delay in everything showing. Now when setting albums to download if new songs are added you have to undownload them and then redownload to get the new songs. Plus they raised the pricing recently. For what benefit?
240,It's sucks it's like Spotify but worse
241,"The service is excellent but the app needs to be looked into. It doesn't stop playing music if you close it (you need to manyally pause), sometimes it will fail loading any content and the only way to make it work again is to reboot the app twice, there is no option to download single song (you need to put them on a playlist to download), half of the recommendations in the home page have nothing to do with the users tastes (from highlights downwards it's all useless)"
242,love this app
243,Best music app I've come across yet!!
244,"good app, however it crashes a lot and takes long to read downloaded content if internet is not so good."
245,"App is frustratingly slow. It takes 10 seconds to load any section. My network speed is good, and even download songs at 5mbps, so the problem is in the app or deezer servers. I regret paying a year subscription as the app is becoming worse each time. I will move to another service asap"
246,It's good can't lie
247,"Latest update removes the ability to use the sleep timer with AI generated playlists (Flow), this is an essential feature for me! Please bring it back!"
248,Syncing the app between devices doesn't work. The slider shows the last known place but just gets stuck not playing anything. I can only restart & play podcast from the beginning
249,"Used to be excellent. Now you can't access your downloaded or favorited music offline which kinda defeats the whole purpose. I'm a premium subscriber but I'll be cancelling, sadly as my playlist is about 5 years old."
250,"I give it 5 stars (and bought an annual subscription) because I truly believe Deezer is the best overall streaming service available. I just wish it didn't feel so sluggish compared to Spotify/Apple Music, and especially when compared to Tidal."
251,"Plz fix your app do you do testing after updates? Its a new bug everytime this time theres 2, forst one when i click on the deezer app its loading the webpage instead pf the app why? And number 2 when im connected to a bluetooth speaker if of get any kind of notification the musoc mutes itself until i go back on the app and then it carries on playing the same part of the song over and over fix your dam app or im getting spotify instead you got 1 week"
252,Very marginal podcast inventory
253,Awesome
254,not the best i have paid non stop and keeps reminding me to pay really!!!! sort it out
255,"Many small bugs that, in term, hinder user experience. Random tracks that get a popup ""unable to load"" and then work fine by clicking retry, playlists playing in reverse order, different artists sharing the same profile, artists with 2 fans making it to some of the top charts playlists (how ? Nobody heard of them, check for your app security) and probably more that I forgot. The app would be much better without all these small but annoying isssues."
256,"Very good. Like the sound quality. It is better than Spotify premiums quality. But there is certainly songs it hasn't got, which Spotify has. The reason for the 4/5. It's little more expensive than I like, but the extra price is worth it for better audio. So far, mostly pleased. I'll give it another month to see what the music üéµ recommend feature is like. Spotify song recommendations is amazing. I hope Deezers is too. Tuesday 6th June 2023. I've updated to 5 Star. Music recommendation 5/5."
257,I like the catalog of music that they have.
258,I found almost everything I have searched for. Definitely the best music app üëå
259,Deezer is the best for HiFi Music and Podcasts
260,It crush to often
261,"Even this 1 star is way too much! Don't be so greedy! Let the people listen to some music for free! Anything we want, not just something you think we want to listen. This app is all about Premium these days as in subscription-based model and that's never a good thing. It's all about the money now, NOT the music! Music comes second in this app. Why not making it a one-time purchase model instead? That would be so much better. Nobody likes subscriptions! That goes for me too."
262,Estatic
263,YouTube Music the best ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êü§ó!!!
264,Works great üòÉ
265,the best music streaming app I've found. I've tried Spotify and other the ability to link to devices moderately easier nothing half a good as deezer
266,true hifi sound not like spotify
267,It's great but a lot of songs are still not on it like the other streaming platforms.
268,√¨p
269,Good
270,"Waaaaayyyy better than Amazon prime music unlimited, sound, control, support, value."
271,music unlocked üîìüò≠ music galore
272,Not affordable.
273,"Four stars for now, because when looking for a song it wants you to type the exact song name and artist, which is quite difficult when you don't remember the song and actually need help from Deezer to locate the song. üôÇ"
274,this guy is out of the curve! rock and roll
275,"Haven't used since 2019, thought id have another look. First thing is that you have to answer if you are male, female or non binary, what has that got to do with you... then it insists you choose 3 artists, to personalise my content... i don't want personalised content, can't move forward unless i choose 3, can't even delete account until you have chosen 3, so choose 500 then managed to delete the account."
276,Amazing
277,H d's I think ü§î üò≥
278,Cool!
279,great and inspirational words
280,"Advertised on Google that they had a specific artist that I was looking for, but they don't."
281,Flac quality is unbeatable and blows the competition at this price point.
282,l'appli s'arr√™te toute seule apr√®s 3 chansons...
283,üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
284,Best ever
285,"NAO PERCAM SEU TEMPO COM ESSE LIXO. Deezer √© um lixo. N√£o importa se est√° usando Wifi ou 4G, leva 3 horas pra carregar uma √∫nica musica na pesquisa, msm consumindo 30GB da mem√≥ria do meu telefone. Deezer is worse and worse. Thinking seriously about replacing it with Spotify. Deezer takes a lifespan and a half to load the content you search meanwhile on YouTube app, which I haven't even subscribed in, it happens in a snap."
286,√≥timo!!
287,No way to change password or cancel account
288,Deezers got me down cold. Yo love it!
289,Only good when you pay for it what I mean is downloaded a bunch of songs and soon as the trial was over so is your play list might have continued but it's all about the money with every one anymore and that's just wrong and you use my data and I can't take that back or charge you all wow really wrong .
290,"It's a pretty good service and has a very nice app. But if the internet connection is anything less than perfect nothing will play, even downloaded playlists will just get stuck loading infinitely."
291,Giood.c
292,Gay
293,keeps stopping
294,Very clear instructions
295,"In general, great app, best amount of music a man can get, I have the premium although the widget isn't working the song catcher, flow and play aren't working properly which is why I'm rating 3 stars, guys, fix this up will you, once things are orderly be sure I will rate the app 5 stars, although my 5 doesn't mean much ü§£ü§£ü§£"
296,like Spotify but for audiophiles. selection isn't quite as good but those crisp highs and tonal lows in my headphones more than make up for it.
297,The most buggy streaming service I have ever tried besides Tidal. Spotify I'm coming back!!!
298,This app is missing an essential feature that Spotify nails: being able to use the app to control Deezer running on other devices.
299,"-have been using free version for about 5 years now, still love it! -3 years later, i still feel the same way! so eight years i have been with deezer. . .which started out being muve music, free with your cricket phone service. have been with metro pcs for years now, but deezer is connected to my google or my facebook (or both) so my playlists and favorite songs are all still with me!!! super awesome app -10 years now! still love my deezer music app üíñ great service!"
300,"Does not work and have no way to cancel subscription As suggested by your support system, followed the link and I am back where i started. No way of accessing information. When i try to open the deezer app, i am told i do not have an account. However an amount is deductedeach month for a subscription ."
301,Simply the best.
302,Not free
303,"Since a few months, you can't quickly remove a lot of songs from the queue by swiping. Now you always have to wait for the ""undo' prompt to disappear until you can remove the next song in the queue by swiping. Really annoying, especially since this used to work quickly before."
304,Sad
305,"I'm so happy that I discovered Deezer. Believe me I've tried them all. In fact I'm so happy that I'm prepared to start paying my subscription on the 5th of June already when I get paid, instead of when my free trail ends."
306,ok very good music
307,"The app is very good. I mean, the quality of the audio is just great! But on the performance side, it can do better. Sometimes it takes a while to start playing even the songs that already downloaded, or when you click in a song that is in the search tab, the song doesn't play, I have to go to options and click in play next. My point is: There are some bugs that need to be fixed and the app needs to be faster and more fluid (dynamic) to use."
308,"Dear Deezer, can you please fix the Flow algorithm (if there is any)? If I happen to have listened to a some French music before I turn to Flow, all the Flow songs are French, no matter if I choose different ""moods"" (Party, Chill,..). The same happens if I happen to have been listening to some Brazilian music, or in the case this evening all Flow is Flemish music, on all moods. I expect Flow to be a genuine random mix of music and also different music when I select different moods. Thank you."
309,Still plays song in reverse order & repeats shuffles! Terrible app
310,Music 10/10 you get can follow your favourite songs and artists
311,They steal your money for nothing
312,"2 star for price, if was less expense worth 4 star, useless for notstop playing songs, only few tracks on repeat, need search, flow inst flow, is stop after time, same tracks, spotify pee on u, almost and tidal."
313,I did that now & it worked thank you very much for the answer
314,The amount paid for commercial free listening is not worth it. I have been using the app for several years now and I am not happy with it anymore. On top of it stopping music mid song it is displayed a complete different song and artist.... Sorry but I'm unable to make a complaint through the email you provided me. Please try and fix these issues ASAP!
315,"Not as reliable as other music apps, but having flac quality and paying more to artists is the way to do it!"
316,Wonderful to use
317,Very good has all your favourite artists very good designs
318,Y'all need to get rid of commercials and more music and shuffle button and stop asking music I didn't request it keeps stopping
319,I enjoy the Sound quality.
320,Interface is really good. Has excellent content on African music
321,best app !
322,Free service is no longer offered but this app remain preinstalled and cannot be removed.
323,thanks for the subscription its abgood app.
324,Better than Pandora
325,Deezer has the same high quality sound then Amazon Music so I quit Amazon Music due to the app running slow and stopping so I perfer to use Deezer
326,not available in our country so ....
327,Deezer is the Bomb my number 1 streaming music app. Great variety and sound performance witout glitching. Deezer The Best #1
328,I love it I ain't found a song it's denied ame of playing
329,getting better at it I Love your get down
330,excellent üëç
331,This is the best one.
332,Awesome!!!!
333,"Play Flow is (was!) *the* main reason to like Deezer over Spotify - and they broke it. Home screen shortcuts don't work. Songcatcher and Play Flow still appear when I long-tap on the app, but both give an error ""App is not installed"". The app is installed, opens with no problem, shows my favourites, playlists etc same as ever. I'm on v. 7.0.29.67 ie the latest version; looks like this 15/5/2023 update ruined Deezer for me."
334,Won't allow me to subscribe because I'm not from white person country.
335,"Discographies are poorly laid out. There needs to be a new section under an artist that contains main album releases. To many popular artists (dead or alive) have so many anniversary, special editions, live, platinum, re-release, remastered, re-re-release etc it turns discographies into a nightmare. Just have section devoted to proper album releases."
336,Family and profiles or accounts as members. Also it was easier to get my Spotify playlists here than to another Spotify account. I hope the rest will be as good as this very promising start.
337,"Excellent, runs without it open."
338,"I love this app, have had it since it was introduced to me by Cricket. I've been able to add so many anime and A-Pop songs to my various playlists. Although, some songs disappear over time for one reason or another, I have no complaints. Now my song catcher will not work, and has not worked in weeks. My internet connection is strong, yet that is the error message I get. Please fix. This is my source for new anime and asian music and artists."
339,"It's a decent service even when free, the sponsored song gets very repetitive though as they only have one at a time but sometimes you don't even hear it. Annoyingly though they have got rid of the widget on the home lock screen so you have to physically go into your phone to skip a track which is not ideal"
340,Not available in Philippines sucks.. no free version ultra sucks
341,pretty goooood
342,My information has been found on the dark web source coming from deezer and you wont let me delete my account and if i get hacked because i cant delete this account and lose all connection to this dark web hack your gonna have a lawsuit a HUGE ONE YOU BET YOUR BUTT YOU WILL
343,"The app crashes more often than not and has problems when queing large amount of songs. Lots of other small tweaks that could make the experience smoother, but it gets the job done and more impirtantly you can play flac's through it."
344,"I love the high sound quality provided for tracks, as well as the functionality of creating and editing playlists. Phenomenal music app."
345,"Just incredible cubs, not free Estonia and many many countries.. Anyway, don't send those bastards a red penny too! USE TORRENT OR ANY FREE APP"
346,"It's one of the best music services, but having a lot of obscure artist mixed really start to annoy me, like for example camellia has a top song that isn't from he, this was a problem with Spotify but apparently they fixed it having a way for artist to block they're name."
347,"Love this app. I have been using it for quite a few months. Sound quality is amazing on premium. I migrated from Spotify premium deezer has way clearer audio. But recently, my playlist has been playing backwards. If I start at the top of my Playlist it only plays one song. If I start at the bottom, then it plays all the songs but backwards. As in oldest song first. Please fix this or allow a setting to be made for us to manually switch the direction of the playlist. Please fix."
348,"Absolutely trash, they keep playing random music during the playlist I created. Do not use on mobile they think they are smarter than you with they dogs1ht recommendation algorithm."
349,The best streaming system I 've I have used yet &I have been streaming music for 12 years just the best yet.
350,"Better than Tidal, YouTube Muisc, and Amazon Music, IMO. I love the UI and the quality of hifi. I don't run into any issues using this, and it seems to get better every update. The flow option is cool too it's catered to your taste so the more music you like the better."
351,Good app
352,I did have this sit but for some reason it was not uploading what I wanted to play so ended up taking off my phone
353,"This would be a great app if the ""Normalize Volume"" option wasn't broken"
354,Very good
355,Love the app
356,liked track list could be better
357,"randomly shuts off while playing music. free version sucks, plays suggested songs instead of songs in the actual playlist. ""for you"" playlists feel like random artists that dont belong together."
358,"Straight up Garbage, not much else to say"
359,It's very nice app. There are a lot of musician from around the world. It good listen to song while cycling or jogging. Some track has lyrics can read to know the words. One thing I don't like it is can't download the music.
360,"Absolutely love this app!! It's the best app I've found for music so far! And they make the best playlist, perfectly fit for you‚ô•Ô∏è I'm in love with this app for realüòçüíØ"
361,"Hope you like covers and belligerent devices. Will just make up songs ""ok playing 'something you definitely did not say' on deezer"" And even when it gets the song right it's 99% chance of being a terrible cover version."
362,"Fix bugs and optimize this app. It's almost a disaster! Spotify is smooth with close to zero bugs, but this app have 5-10 bugs and slower in certain moments. Code need to be optimized guys!"
363,very good
364,"The app is Broken, i go to play my favorites and the playback stops from an error saying only one instance of your account can be playing music at a time. But im only using my phone. And it changed my playlist to a completely different and Random artist song que for i have no idea why it just changes what im listening too like a ghost went and pulled a song from the internet randomly , i think im being hacked or something fishy is going on. Every time i use it this happenes. Song plays n stopsüëé"
365,Best sounding Hi-Fi music out of the Hi-Fi apps available in my opinion.
366,best app for music!!
367,Love Deezer
368,Ok
369,Thanks for deleting my review ü§£ as I said they don't always 100% stick to their offers I'd be careful much cheaper alternatives to music apps than this.
370,Can't login....pliiz help......
371,"Way To Many Ad's !!,, Great Application Deezer Is Great üëçüèª ‚≠ê ‚úåüèª"
372,So you guys fixed the problem about olaying music offline But now poweramp equalizer is not working on deezer so please let users to use any equalizer on the app!!!
373,"Still bugged EQ Been using Deezer for many years now. Unfortunately the entire time they haven't had a working EQ. Works for one track only, the moment you change track the EQ settings are lost. Tested on too many devices to count as I'm a long time user. You'd think they'd have fixed it by now. Offering HQ audio yet won't let you tailor it to your audio device without having to do it for every single song!!! Check if the EQ works once you change track, it won't"
374,Sleep timer stopped working since last update. Unable to fix.
375,O meu flow n√£o muda h√° dias
376,"I quit Spotify and went through a whole year of trying different streaming services (Tidal, Apple Music, Qobuz, YouTube Music, etc.). At the end, I chose Deezer. The interface was easy and intuitive. The artist recommendations were the best of all the services. Best of all, the artists get a larger share of the money than Spotify and some of the other services."
377,Why am I paying 11.99 for an app that glitches with every search and skips like I'm playing a CD in the 90s???
378,I canceled this program and uninstalled it but they still took money from my account.
379,Love it
380,Best flow and music app that recognises even the most eclectic tastes in music (such as my own).
381,It's just as good as spropfi
382,Unable to try app. The app does nothing when I select confirm on age verification. Have tried removing and installing App. The confirmation icon just spins for a moment when I input my age and select it.
383,The app has a couple of bugs but overall a great music experience.
384,Serenity in vibrations
385,Very high music quality üòò
386,"I used to use this App very much, Now since last update when I try to play a song it stop at the middle of if"
387,Deezermynuts
388,Help me with jams
389,love non stop tunes
390,M segmqm7 .
391,UPDATED: The customer service for this app is HORRIFIC. Been using this app since Cricket discontinued Muve Music almost 10 years ago. Been paying for it from the same bank for the same amount of time. I switched to a different debit card 2 days ago (same bank) & Deezer's payment processor won't accept the payment. They keep emailing me blaming my bank but I have confirmed REPEATEDLY that my bank NEVER RECEIVED A TRANSACTION FROM THEM to begin with! Deezer's in France & has no phone# to call.
392,love this app
393,It's not free
394,modeil
395,love it and has almost every song I can think of
396,"Hi, I'm on the family plan and the app just kidded all of us out and won't allow us to log back in. What seems to be the problem?"
397,"These days, I'm getting annoyed by the app it's full of bugs and stops for no reason sometimes. I keep updating by nothing changes. Please bring back the old deezer. What's up with the new update. Why are my albums and playlists not arranged in grid form."
398,app not opening up says API required
399,I really enjoy Deezer the sound quality is top notch this app is definitely a one of the best music apps around I will definitely recommend it to my friends
