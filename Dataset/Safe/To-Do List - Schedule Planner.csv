18,"It's a great and to the point app that is easy to navigate. It's customizable to a point and easy to overview. However I would like the tasks of different categories to be of various colors, so that you differentiate them better from another when looking at the tasks of all categories.

95,"This app is very helpful and convenient for people with ADHD. It's easy to set up tasks and reminders, and you can also set up reminders to drink water or take your pills. But it would be even better if there was an option to set up deadlines and reminders for subtasks. And also, I understand that the creators have to get some revenue from the app, but I think that standard theme colors (like red, yellow, etc.) and at least one good-looking widget theme should be available for everyone."

170,"subscribed because it has a watch app too, and i have adhd. regretted it on day one. you cannot skip tasks, if you dont do them they just wont appear the next day. the widget is capricious, and wants to use whatever space it wants. cannot use widget to do anything else but open the app and to check a task - no skipping. the interface is boring, the scheduling tool not good enough. the syncing is a joke. use your calendar instead."
171,"This app help me alot for becoming best version of myself, Thank you!"

199,Very helpful
200,"""I am disappointed with this app as it lacks a trial period and requires immediate payment. Additionally, the app's inability to rotate on the tablet and its ordinary features do not justify the cost."""
201,I give 5 ‚≠ê because i find it easy to use üôÇ
202,I have saved a ton of money using the to-do list scheduler!!! Lot less trips to the store and I use less recycled paper products.
203,"hi, I want to install it badly but if I'm gonna click the 'install' button, nothing happens. I don't knock what's the problem, Please help me. I really need this."
204,"I should pay for some to unlock, it's not pocket friendly. I should subscribe for more facility"
205,I just like the interface of this app and it helps to manage the task extremely well and the we can add notes and sub tasks which is very easy and good.
206,Literally the best app every It always help me remember things easily and it doesn't have any adds.love this app<3

212,Uu
213,Good app .he help me to much
214,These kind of apps need to be fast and efficient to be worth the effort. The advertisement prevents that.
215,Great
216,Works better than the default
217,Nah I give 4 stars BC I have to pay
218,Good app.

221,Good
222,I like this app
223,I would Prefer if you would not add the province because the beginners are the small child like me are going to suffer by not having the pro and by not having those bit of templates and something more which isn't your app for you only proves one to us and on whenever I select that it says to upgrade to pro I'm a child and I can't do that so that's where I'm going to give this a 2 and a 1/2 but it's not that options I'm going to do this a 2
224,It's nice
225,good
226,best
227,Work really good
228,ÿ¨ŸäÿØ
229,Works okay but has ads? Why does a to-do list need adds? Just use pen and paper ten times easier.
230,"I don't know why we have to pay for basic stuffs like notifications , alarms, widgets.. You keep tasking us with such baduc functions? The most annoying thing is showing frequent ads after all this!! Me, and other 300 people working for me will all uninstall this app today! Until you fix this, bye"

239,Best it's help me lot
240,Acha hai
241,This is the type of to-do list I've been looking for. I did pay for the one-timw Pro version as I didn't want ads. Not a terrible price based on other apps or buying a paper journal. It's also easy to use.
242,Fantastic app I started using recently but loved it ps apperance and performance level easy to use and very helpful to track our schedule
243,Superb!
244,I really like to do this because I get all of my stuff done and it really. Helps me out a lot so I won't have to remember so that's I get it 5 stars. I really like this app and you should try it too.
245,Ads every 2 minutes in a productivity app defeats the purpose. Pro should be for more features not to remove an artificial problem you've created for the user.
246,ÿπÿßŸÑ€å€å€å€å€å€å€å€å ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿÆŸàÿ®Ÿá Ÿà ÿ±ÿßÿ≠ÿ™ Ÿà ÿßÿ≥ÿßŸÜ

284,"the widget isnt scalable and has few functions: no skipping using the widget. if you skip a daily task one day, it wont appear the next day as it should, so you have to go back and check it on a previous day. syncing is a JOKE. watch app exists but no skipping or tile. i wanted my money back but i'm not eligible. use your calendar instead. no reason to download this, it offers nothing new. i regret purchasing premium."

I felt that she was genuine and decided to download the app. The app wasn't too complicated and was easy to use and function. However, I think the premium membership should not oop up frequently when users enter the app as they might find it frustrating."

326,My favorito app
