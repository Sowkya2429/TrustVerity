0,Good platform but terrible chat optimization. also I would enjoy watching live streams in a quality other than 144p
1,"this app is the worse, searching for a channel is impossible you literally need to know the channel name to find it, if you search someone's name will never show up, the fast forward does bot work on phones with curved edge, terrible app"
2,"This is my 3rd post. 1st rating was 1 star, 2nd was 3 stars, now back to 1 star. They take 1 step forward then 2 steps back!! Background theme is way better however why would you get rid of the minplayer feature, dumb!! Video rating system is way better, but now the app constantly crashes! And when you reopen the video it restarts. It doesn't pick up where you left off. When will u add a damn history section u i can easily find videos ive already watched? And bring back the mini player screen!!"
3,Real truth
4,"I have a motorola edge 5G UW (2021). The last update prior to this was excellent I was able to see what my phone was playing on rumble on my truck radio and stop and resume and now I did the update last week and I can't do that anymore. It stops all the time & I can't see where I left off, if I go off the page and no longer plays anymore & starts from that point or I'm back at again the beginning it used to show my progress and the name of the show I'm watching on my screen in both of my trucks"
5,Shame it only has auto quality. Which sucks when phone service is garbage. Website is better for this reason alone A couple of options are better than just auto...give data saver/low at the very least
6,Great to have a free speech platform out there. Rumble will surpass YouTube one day.
7,"Haven't used the App yet, I'm sure it needs some work. Leaving a five star review to support freedom of speech, keep up the good work!"
8,Battery usage is way too high.
9,Love this non censored app and all its content but really needs subtitles for the hearing impaired. Can this be added please?
10,I am so tired of getting a notification about a man saving a town from a hurricane. Please God fix this I have gotten that same notification two dozen times in the past 2 months.
11,"Plays videos. Not very feature rich. For instance, it doesn' even open when clicking rumble link."
12,Good app
13,Finally a great app. And they added dark mode
14,"We believe in you; starting a video service to compete with YouTube isn't easy. Keep up the good work and tackle those glitches! I find that I don't even have to complain about problems, I think ""Oh, that's a problem"" log out, log in a few days later, and it's already been addressed. Like the videos not saving their play position when you back out? You guys were on it in a weeks time from me noticing. I never said a thing, never had a chance. The community beat me to it, and you listened üò≠"
15,"Ditch YouTube and go with the app that DOESN'T CENSOR FREE SPEECH. The above was written over a year ago. Now,""Free Speech Rumble"" censors comments with naughty words in them."
16,The FireTV app is vastly improved!!
17,Would love to see audio only mode and support for Android Auto to listen to shows while driving. Sometimes issues with streaming video quality being pixelated when casting that doesn't seem to return to recover.
18,"Just upgraded app, and now videos auto-play. There's currently no option to turn this feature off. That's why I'm giving 3 stars"
19,Lately I can't cast the video I start. Rumble casts the wrong video or if it is the correct video it stops and starts over. So tired of this.
20,Videos don't play. They just sit there with the buffer wheel spinning. Nothing ever plays. I wanted this to replace YouTube. What good does it do if it won't work?
21,"I wish this app would get chromecast working properly, and with a queue; It's the only thing keeping me on youtube."
22,"FIX THE SEEK BAR.. You can barely touch it without accidentally hitting other functions while playing a video ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Love Rumble, but hate terrible UI/UX design."
23,"Sub par What kind of app is this? You can't even seek through the progress bar by clicking, you have to drag. This is supposed to be a publicly listed company that is competing against YouTube? It lacks basic UI/UX functions of a video player. Doesn't show you history of your watched videos either. How hard is it to develop these features? Guys, you need to step it up."
24,Can you plz stop the auto replay it is really annoying... And can you please add video quality option. I don't like when videos automatically play on 1440p. I want to be able to pick which graphics quality I want. And also time stamps. Someone content creators I watch put time stamps but it doesn't reflect on the video. That also needs fixing
25,This app never works. It's very bad.
26,Place share videos that you created without being censored or watch vids of new age creators.
27,Very poor tech on Mobile Livestreams.
28,i never wanted this app and it showed up on my device ... very sus
29,"I love your service, but the app needs a lot of work."
30,Requesting a feature to be added: Like the app however I would love a feature where I could minimize the player like YouTube has so I could look up what video to watch next while listening/watching a podcast. This would not only help us as users but your app as well getting more content to the viewers eyes.
31,"Coming along by leaps and bounds. But they need to add the floating video feature so I can search for a new video while I watch one at the same time like YouTube. Otherwise, amazing."
32,Rumble is More popular for alternative information then you too because YouTube does not like anything that gets close to the truth. But until the last update rumble was able to play in the background while I did other things on my phone. It had a feature that was designed to use in the car but it worked great any other time. It allowed you to minimize a video to the background and you could continue listening to it while you did something else. You cannot do that anymore. Help!
33,It's pretty decent but the app seriously needs some work while movovering in the app is fine but when it comes to uploading you can't even do that an also you can't customize your channel while on the app you can only do it on pc but other than that I do see alot of potential for rumble as an ulterntive platform to youtube :)
34,Great place for alternative news
35,I had tried Rumble out a while back and it was not an ideal experience. But I kept in mind that it's a new platform and I knew I'd come back to see how far it's come. I can now say that they have really stepped up their game. It still has its bugs but it's 100% usable in its current state.
36,Would love to use this more than youtube but not enough entertainment to keep my interest. No movies or titles to watch . There are just channels. Yes I do watch a few channels but after that no need to use app but just once a day. We are looking for a youtube replacement. Just not enough entertainment unless you know what channel to look for. And most recommended channels on this app I don't like. Most recommended channels are left leaning channels. I thought this was a conservative style app.
37,Wish I could give a better review. They have a long way to go to be a youtube competitor. Any publicly available videos you post you dont ever be able to find when searching. Idk how rumble has continued to let this be an issue.
38,Better than YouTube
39,I would do 5 Stars if they ever emailed people back in their support. I've sent multiple emails and never received a response. I have an account that was mistakenly deactivated and I need it back up. If I never received a response I will leave the platform. Thanks
40,It's alright nothing like spotify. They have an autoplay feature which this one does not so I have to constantly keep picking the episodes. It's hard to keep track of which I've seen and which I haven't since it doesn't say which ones I have
41,Rumble doesn't make it easy to change profile image on the app. Also there are clear misses with no cover photo & no bio to list below username.
42,Simply doesn't work anymore. Application has stopped
43,"Ive made the switch to Rumble from YT as my main viewer. It has most of the creator/podcast videos I would have watched anyway, but unlike YT, Rumble seems to respects free speech more and allows its creators the feeedom to post what they want without worry about being knee jerked censored or banned. The main issue I've had with Rumble is, when on my tablet, when searching videos it goes verticle, but then widscreen for the videos. On the phone that works good but on tablets its annoying."
44,"Can't sign up or in,tired of jumping, though hoops to get in."
45,I am unable to get on rumble i have tried and tried
46,It seems the app doesn't want to use my speaker if I was using headphones or car link before. Close and reopening the app doesn't fix the issue.
47,"Couldn't use without signing in, decided to just close for now. Some time later I get a notification ad from the app."
48,"The auto play can't be turned off when scrolling, this app now uses x10 more data. When I can turn that off I will change my rating"
49,"for some reason when i pause a video in fullscreen it automatically changes to regular size pretty frustrating, would be 5* otherwise"
50,"Trash app experience. Takes up too much bandwidth, & casting to devises consistently causes stutters. On phone, app will pause stream once phone screen turns off, what happened to the automobile toggle that prevented this? Can't adjust vid quality on live streams. Watching exclusive content is pointless if the app won't work in real time. No where ready to take on YT if this continues. Odysee at least works, too bad Rumble pillaged the creators that were migrating there. No watch history, why?"
51,"Decent, but media notification gets stuck even after playback stopped and app closed. Going back to search or feed seems to fix it. Also, a recent Livestream I was watching on delay jumped me to the end and then would only play at 1x speed with no timeline bar. But worked normally in browser (desktop site on mobile because the mobile site is quite bad)."
52,Free Speech Yeah
53,Way better than YouTube! I'm sick of YouTube censorship!
54,New update very buggy on android
55,Garbage. Won't let me login at all. Terrible app. Do not use
56,"The app closes randomly. Rumble doesn't track progress in a video, so if you leave and come back, like if it randomly closes, it starts the video over. No filtering videos on a channel. All videos are in the same spot. videos from 0:30 to 3:55:09 are all in one list. There is no way to search or filter. I like to listen to long form stuff and not watch it. I'm not tracking my exact spot in a video while in the field, neither is Rumble, makes it my 4th or 5th pick to use."
57,The standard in video platforms
58,Constantly crashes. Playback stops after a couple minutes upon minimizing app. Can't do anything else while a livestream is in background because playback stops. Playback stopped while I was writing this review.
59,"Promotes itself as a freedom app but it's based in Communist Canada. Not very free then, is it."
60,Pretty lame i can't move the time bar to later in the video after it restarts for no reason - can only hit the forward 15second so lame. Being able to choose 360p video quality helps but still unlistenable with all the buffering (while my data is being uploaded) - please offer 140p option for people with horrible tmobile internet
61,Doesn't let me watch in auto mode anymore. Used to be able to put phone in pocket and still listen. Sucks now...
62,"It would be great if you could put your on phones camera photos on your page. I love the freedom of speech here. I can speak my peace and interact with the people I'm watching on the live stream and with others around the country watching. We are not having watch what we say like on FAKEBOOK. I got tired of being a HARD CORE FAKEBOOK INMATE... I am part of a group of people on ""The Mind of Jamal"" called ""Rumble Rebels"" I'm proud to be a Rumble Rebel. Thank Rumble...Ron...JohnnyReb1"
63,1.) Need offline listening feature for those times when you're in an area with poor mobile coverage. 2.) Playlists! Definitely need a playlist feature so that you can build a line-up for your long commute.
64,"This app has matured greatly. Please give us the ability to turn off autoplay while scrolling thru our feed. It uses more data & seeing the video thumbnail is more efficient [and safer] for finding the video that you want to watch, especially in the car. I like the background play option very much. Thank you. üôÇ"
65,Getting better rumble. Keep them updates coming. I do appreciate THE free speech platform. It just needs an exterminator for the bugs and some optimization.
66,"Terrible for slow data. Most unlimited phone plans have a cutoff where they begin to throttle your data speed. So when I click a ""Video Quality"" button, I expect to be able to change the damn quality with it. You say jumpy videos are bad. Prove it by allowing EVERY video and Live stream to be played at a lower quality. Why is this even a problem? Do you hate poor people?"
67,"Loving the new interface and features, this is a total upgrade and loving the app now! Anyone notice that they are constantly signed out of the app for some reason??"
68,This app works extremely well and is easy to use as well as contains good content.
69,Edit: Search needs to be more intuitive. If I misspell something it can't find something even close! I NEED to be able to edit my comment Or be able to post multiple comments Or be able to delete the comment and then repost a fixed comment. It is not letting me do any of that without refreshing the whole page and losing video. Things that need help: Being able to leave app and still have videos play in minimized window and not lose progress.
70,"Rumble is my go to video platform. The Jun 2023 update now puts my screen to sleep. I've tried to change the settings, but it only offers sound only or pip. I appreciate that it saves my spot now, but I still need the ability to keep my watch history, library and saved or favorites."
71,Still no way to find my old comments. There should be a history page of of likes and comments. That's really silly. It's not on the browser or in the app that being said why download the app as there's no benefit to it
72,Cast to TV doesn't play what I'm currently watching. It casts something different to TV. This only started with this new update.
73,Can't cast to my tv. Why on Earth WOULDN'T they fix this & quick? YouTube VERY early on had this going for it & it makes 100% of the other bugs bearable because you could watch it on your tv. This is 100% why I & everybody else haven't committed to Rumble yet! Fix this Rumble! It's costing you MILLIONS of views every hour! I can't believe you have the button to do cast but IT DOESN'T WORK IT JUST SCANS ENDLESSLY & NEVER FINDS ANYTHING! I'll check back in 6 months to see if you've fixed this!
74,Terrible interface. Hard to navigate. Shame
75,FREE SPEECH #1
76,"No longer works with Chromecast. When I try casting a specific live stream to my TV, it will scan some other live stream. Please fix."
77,Journalism and truth have a home on rumble! thank you rumble!!!!
78,"This is my third update with this app. Went from 3 stars to 2. The app is very unresponsive. Very slow, glitchy, not user-friendly. And if you decide you got to make a comment on someone's video you better proofread it really good because there is no way to edit once you release it. There's no option to edit or even delete it so you can rewrite your comment. That's horrible. You need an edit and a delete option for the viewer."
79,"App needs: - I should be able to scroll a video by touching, not dragging only üòê - save a progress of viewed videos automatically, like in YouTube. - save comments automatically when I leave window accidentally or press back button ""<"", like in YouTube. - allow editing and deleting of comments, like in YouTube. Seriously, guys? I can't edit or delete my own comments? Wow üòê - Subscriptions page need a search button üîç - The channel that I watch all the time is not on top of My Feed. Why? üòë"
80,Excellent service. Latest update has been great. It fixed the video pausing every time the screen auto rotated.
81,Buggy AF
82,Randomly will start to buffer (with full signal)and restarts in a different spot from where it stopped.
83,I love that it keeps playing audio even after I turn my screen off. This app deserves 5 stars for that alone.
84,Great app.. YouTube sucks
85,"Tried to give Rumble a chance over YouTube, but when it ask me to log back in every day, I say it is not worth it. Will wait till better option comes along"
86,"New edit. App seems to be freezing on multiple phones today. Removing a star, logins using Google do not work sometimes or it takes a couple tries."
87,"Haven't been able to open since the last update. That makes this a useless app, don't you think?"
88,Great content good steam app getting better
89,App keeps shutting down on my S7 when it starts to load
90,App and website not working. Wouldn't allow me to even register. How do they want viewers when you can't register to use the darn thing..
91,Please add some more payment methods like phone pay Google pay etc and awesome app üòçüòç
92,When I hit the cast button it plays some random video instead of the one Playing on my phone.
93,"Jesus Christ this app is buggy. it constantly stops for no reason, then just closes out. it also uses a massive obscene amount of data. also the pixel 7 pro is a garbage phone and you'll regret buying it"
94,"The app is getting better, and the resume feature for videos you left without finishing is fantastic, but its biggest issue is its lack of customisation settings. And PLEASE add a bug reporting feature."
95,Why are channels I subscribe to not automatically showing up in my listings? Is Rumble trying to control what I watch? Evidently.
96,"Rumble Excellent platform for free speech from any side RIGHT or LEFT. And I recommend everyone that does anything outdoors as far as fishing, hiking, or hunting should get a Rumble account and start posting today because tomorrow is going away with your ability to put things on YouTube and Facebook. Just saying try it out and see for yourself."
97,"Love rumble but this app on my Samsung flip z4 says it's still running in the background even tho I closed it and force stopped it. So not to sure what's going on there, but if they fix that, then it will definelty be my main streaming app."
98,Continues to run in background after app has been exited. Must be aborted thru Devl Opt> Running Serv menu or a Force Stop from Settings>Apps
99,"Massive battery hog... Otherwise good enough. 3.5* I still have to swipe a row of thumbnails (which icon is that tiny ovoid image?) or type the name with correct spelling, capitalization, spacing to find the channel I'm looking for but it's almost a solid app now. Gobbles battery far faster than any other on this device (pixel)"
100,"This is a call for people to join the 1 or 5 star club. Let's push Rumble to improve. 1 star or 5 stars, no more middle nothing ground. Today's a 1 star. Now I have a channel that I haven't subscribed to, showing up in my subscribed list. With no obvious way of removal. So I blocked the channel. It's still in my subscribed list"
101,"I WANT THIS APP TO WORK‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï App was FINALLY working until last update. Constant buffering again. Back to ScrewTube. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è p.s. Still no landscape mode on tablet, won't play in portrait mode. Need watch & comments history. Pull it together Rumble! You're not brand new! Hoards are ready to leave YT but can't due to MULTIPLE issues. Fix your app PLEASE. üò•üò•üò•"
102,You seem to have a bug. If i close the app while something is playing it continues to play in the background with no way to stop it other than going to force close. Otherwise it works perfectly.
103,"please put some captions or subtitle like yt, it will be a big help for me and for others"
104,Freedom of speech I guess
105,"Stop pushing notifications to recommend random videos - especially the same one over and over. You've been pushing ""One Man Helped Save A Town From A Hurricane"" over and over for months and I just don't care. There's no option to turn it off. I want to like Rumble, but this is going to make me uninstall."
106,Recently joined Rumble. Great info that I can trust.
107,üëç
108,Worst app on the Internet!
109,It is great
110,Fire üî•
111,Why did this new update remove the Rumble ticket feature? How do i restore the old version of rumble before the recent 2023 update?
112,When I cast to my tv it plays what it wants. Not the video I'm interested in... This is so wierd. Need more quality control badly.
113,I sit while it spins.
114,"So much nicer than youtube, it's not censored so bad everyone has to watch what they say."
115,"Not playing in the background, no quality options , picture in picture doesn't work"
116,Getting better all the time! When I jump into a live show I'm able to rewind to the beginning and listen. At some point the show stops and I'm forced back to the beginning but can not fast forward to where I was. Is this something you guys can fix? Keep up the good work! So thankful for the free speech!
117,Good app rumble #FreeTopG Andrew and tristan tate
118,I DON'T KNOW WHAT WRONG WITH YOUR SITE BUT IT'S ACTING LIKE IT HAS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES üëéüëéüëéüëé
119,"I really want to use this app, but videos repeatedly stop to load while playing. The website works slightly better (just stops a few times in the beginning), so there's no reason for me to keep the app downloaded. I don't have this problem on the YouTube app, the issue isn't on my end."
120,I'm getting alerts even though all notifications are off. Immediate uninstall üñïüèΩ
121,Update after using the app for a couple months. IT SUCKS. Nothing works well. NOTHING
122,Pos app
123,Well configured. Love this platform.
124,"Notifications are trash. I get notifications someone replied to my comments and it doesn't bring me to that comment. So, what's the point? My comments are buried never to be seen again and I'll never know what these people say in response."
125,The quality of live streams of terrible and you can't change the quality manually. Please fix.
126,Creating an account and getting verified is wayyyy harder than it ever should be. The clunkyness of the app makes me want to throw my phone. I try to support yall because free speech saves the world but the app is so annoying I almost want to delete it. If there weren't creators on this app that I want to watch then I would never use this app ever again.
127,"Swapped after last YouTube update caused the already unpleasant platform to fail in its one basic role, as it stopped playing videos entirely for me. Giving this a shot finally. Miss my favorite creators on YT, but this isn't bad as an alternative. Good they have legitimate competition as well."
128,"Terrible video quality. Super low bitrate, low frame rate. Fast motion and action shots are unwatchable. It looks like you're watching a video on dialup. 0/10, do not recommend at all."
129,VeryVery gooood
130,"Shuddering, lacks an option to turn down quality to improve stream performance. Keep your current installation and don't get the latest one. Janky and broken, will review again when fixed."
131,"Enjoying the play when locked, and the intravideo 'pick up where you left off' feature."
132,"Truth can be told here, unlike on that other site, that bans people for speaking the truth!"
133,This app is really unique and very good for content creators and content creation I watch my favorite streams and listen to my favorite podcasts this app is one of a kind and definitely deserves a try
134,"Would love to love Rumble, but you can't seem to keep the app functional on my LG V20, even though the app store says it should be compatible. Current version keeps crashing on launch. Tried reinstalling; got to login screen, but crashed again as soon as I logged in. As much as I hate YouTube, at least their app runs.."
135,Video download for offline viewing please!
136,Register in browser! Can't see anything till you register. Can't see anything unless you have an account! Here use your google account! It's not like you came here because you wanted an alternative to youtube.
137,"Great app, great platform and great service. Fixed every problem I brought to their attention."
138,"An okay app but lacking in content. It's missing a basic feature which is a search filter that would allow you to only see videos uploaded today, within a week, etc. The videos still play even when you lock your phone's screen so that's an upside if you just want to listen to a video while multitasking. Overall though it still needs work to become a really good platform for content."
139,"The latest version has introduced auto-play previews on the home screen! This extremely annoying, distracting, it wastes my data unnecessarily, completely destroys the app experience. It would be polite of the developers to at least give us the option to turn that ""feature"" off... I couldn't find anything in the app settings?"
140,Why is there no watch history or am I missing it
141,Exceptional
142,Can't select where I left off reeeeeee this was working fine
143,"I want to love rumble as some of my favorite commentators have moved here from YouTube. But I have consistent issues watching. Sometimes, the videos go back to the beginning in the middle of watching it. Other times it just won't load properly as if I'm using a dial up connection. If you can't fix these user experience issues, how can you compete with YouTube?"
144,"Lmao, you can't seek in videos, can only skip by 15sec, and it stops playback when changing quality. Doesn't remember the playback position either. So basically complete garbage for long videos."
145,Free Speech
146,Downloaded this just to see jidion interviewing edp445
147,"You get the other two when you role out a proper ""Dark-Mode"" for us. Edit: Ladies and gentlemen, we have darkmode. ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è üåü üåü"
148,Awesome platform
149,"I love the site and the app isn't all bad, but every time I pause or change audio devices or even bump my phone from portrait to landscape the sound dies and I have to force stop to get it back. Fix that and I'm happy to update my review."
150,"I dropped my score to a 2 due to casting. I can cast from the app to a Chromecast, but the video sent is always the won't video. Today I tried to cast, and it kept casting videos I've already watched. Even while the correct video was showing on my phone The app on Android doesn't let me comment on videos. I hit submit, and nothing. Love supporting tech that gives us choice over the monopoly that is google, but it needs some work"
151,App Keeps crashing
152,This is a nice app hope that there is a free streaming for this.
153,"Every time I enter the program, my account is logged out Please solve this problem I love this app so muchü§ç"
154,It was great Beth app I've seen love the lack of censorship let the free-speech flow!!! however since a new update not sure if it's on my phone or the app the app but it will not stop bugging out
155,Free speech
156,"Live chat stopped working. Cleared cache, data and uninstalled and reinstalled. Chat still not working. Also video audio still plays when app is closed. Have to force stop the app in settings to stop audio from playing."
157,Freedom.
158,Cannot disable notifications. Will get notification from streamers I dont even follow.
159,Lag city and performance issues galore and quality is not high which I was surprised at. Needs alot of love and care. And such. There's hope. Somehow the adds don't lag but watching content creators stuff does like the entire video studders
160,Please remove auto play or let us turn it off.
161,Been using Rumble since the beginning. It was a really rough start but is getting better with every update. If you are pro 1A and 2A this is the video platform for you.
162,"Needs more features. 1) make it easier to FWD & RWD by a few seconds. 2) make it more responsive to touches. 3) allow me to resume where I left off when switching platforms (pc, android, firetv, etc)."
163,Much better with each update but please bring back the 15 second jump-back/rewind function
164,All builds after 3.0.14 crash after successful login / on open for me.
165,"Screen will time out as if I'm not watching a video, or using my tablet at all. Rumble is the only video app on my tablet that does this. Likely due to the new update from a week ago (6/13/23), it used to have the opposite problem; if I fell asleep watching a video, the screen would stay on for hours until I woke up and closed it manually."
166,App is non responsive after a video is played.
167,"Back up to 4 stars, things are improving after that big live chat update. I still have my screen going to sleep while watching live streams and whatever you guys ""fixed"" is draining my battery down fast! Work in progress I know. Keep up the great work. Give us a means to get back to the top of our feed, been asking since you took it away!"
168,"If I make the grave mistake of trying to rewind a video, it freezes. Also, it needs to be able to save where you stopped in a video. If I close the app and come back to a video, it restarts from the beginning and like I pointed out earlier, rewinding or forwarding is a grave mistake"
169,Unfiltered news
170,"The app still needs improvement, but I know they will get there. Free speech! Let's do this!"
171,"STILL NO CHANGE on the app. My rating of this app was a year ago and STILL NOT USER FRIENDLY. LANDSCAPE MODE PLEASE. Why does this app still not have Landscape mode accessible. Mind-boggling. Also, there is no watch history or ability to save videos for a later time. In order to be an alternative to YouTube you have to enable and improve on those features the make YouTube so user friendly. UPDATE. Now on Roku you have to login every time you reload the app. It is the ONLY app you have to that."
172,"I've been using this app for a couple of years now... About a month ago, it repeatedly stops working... Like every few seconds... What is happening..? Please fix it... I do not like watching cast through google..."
173,"The only app I use that still buffers repeatedly during a video like its 1999 Update: didn't realize it needed another update so after updating and restarting my phone, I am now 40 minutes into a video and no buffering yet.‚úåÔ∏èüëèüëç"
174,Wonderful information. Wish I didn't have to re-sign in every day. Where's the memory?
175,"Better than YouTube's fascism. If you have issues, try reinstalling. Fixed all my issues instantly. I'm sure Google hates this app almost as much as it hated Parler. Edit: Y'all need to fix your PiP feature. I know Rumble is trying to compete with YouTube. And PiP and background play is essential. My Rumble keeps having issues with PiP that force me to force stop the app. Still five stars because they don't censor like YouTube and FaceBook."
176,A really good app! I enjoy the UNRESTRICTED & UNCENSORED content that I am able to view here.
177,Stops abruptly if you're not live on a live stream when it ends. Will not go back to where you were
178,"Content is good, but still bugs in casting. Which ever video shows at the top of your feed will be the one cast, regardless of which video you select to cast."
179,Freedom
180,"6/18/23:Fix your app, again! The latest system update on my phone has messed with your app! Now it doesn't work correctly!"
181,HATE UPDATES ....this app used to work great. Now after updating it goes dark while watching something which used to not be too big of an issue....but NOW IT GOES DARK AND STOPS!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY??????? IS THERE NOT PEOPLE TESTING OUT THE UPDATES BEFORE APPLYING THEM TO EVERYONE? My complaints seems small and should've been caught! WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHEN ITLL BE FIXED IF AT ALL REALLY!
182,Love the app but you need to add the ability to change the video quality
183,Can never easily find my favorite podcast
184,Just keep getting better. Can't wait for craft and home gardening/homesteading and self repair help channels to show up
185,excellent
186,Bed
187,Keep on keepin on. You fixed my last complaints! üôå. Might I suggest you add picture in picture so you can browse while watching too.
188,Awesome the truth
189,"Used it to watch nyst and my phone froze. Google pixel 6, I have never had my phone freeze! Stuck for 15 minutes before I could power it down and restart it. Immediately uninstalled it."
190,Love this alternative to YT.
191,It's very very hard to login but YouTube just an email and done
192,Free speech.
193,F..k YouTube and it's agenda
194,Can we get a playlist-que function? EDIT: 06/17/2023 Still waiting for a playlist and/or queue feature...
195,"Rumble is great platform. Will not allow me to move to my SD card. When you change this, I'll reinstall. Uninstalled."
196,"They make it impossible to delete or edit your comment unless you use the website, why use the app with less features? Needs ability to have the video play or go down to the bottom while your moving around in the app. Should be able to browse within the app or settings etc while still playing vids. Also background play only plays for 10 to 13 minutes and then stops and then restarts in about 4 to 6 min, and then repeats. Sometimes video even restart from the beginning??"
197,"Edit: the updates made recently have made me change my rate to 5 stars. Original issue resolved. I can play a video in the background now, even if locking my device which I love..The only thing that I feel could be improved is scrolling backwards using the bar is difficult. Love Rumble but would love it even more if it saved my spot in the video I am watching. If I pause it and come back after maybe 20 min, sometimes less, it refreshes and starts at the beginning again."
198,This app is nowhere near ready for release. It's missing basic features: 1. Need an account just to get to any content. 2. Can't create an account in the app bpecause the text is white on a white background. 3. Can't stop a video from playing by closing the app. You have to force quit from the system settings. 4. Backend too slow to keep a video playing continuously. 5. The full screen button closes the video. (6. There's very little high quality content. It's mostly bots reading blog posts.)
199,UI is pretty bad.
200,Works very well.
201,Don't use Rumble. Use MGTOW.TV. MGTOW.TV is what Rumble users are actually looking for. Its a free speech platform that doesn't censor content creators or people in their comment sections. Rumble is a Fake wannabe Youtube that allows slightly more Moderate Conservative than Youtube does. Rumble is missing hundreds of features that users are used to and Rumble erases comments with bad words. MGTOW.TV doesn't erase videos or comments that have bad words.
202,"Cool, app now has dark mode. Just curious why google is censoring this app. I cannot find it by search. Even if I go to Rumble inc store page. I only see the camera app."
203,Excellent app so much better than YouTube
204,Its is an app outside of the Matrix
205,The only reason why I had to rate Rumble 4 stars instead of 5 is due to a few minor features that it's lacking such as being able to scroll through other videos on the rumble feed while watching a video. And unfortunately not as good as YouTube when it comes to speed of loading videos as well as it's speed and buffering on live stream videos. But I like that it doesn't put bs videos in my feed as suggestions and is strongly against censorship. Hoping more improvements are in the near future!!
206,Rumble just for top G üíñüßø
207,"The the app was working fine until about 2 weeks ago, there's a prompt to sign in, I sign in, and the app crashes, this is with the VPN turned off or on, and I've tried re-installing the app several times. I really do want rumblebto succeed, but I also want it to work."
208,"Really need playback options such as set defualt resolution, Turn off the new auto play feature ( so can read thumbnails) this might be asking too much but a tabs feature were i could long press a video and ad it to a playlist or save for later - but the lack of video player options is definitely the biggest problem for me keep up the good work."
209,FIRE YOUR WHOLE DEV TEAM AFTER THIS NEW UPDATE. Same app. I had high hopes for rumble but i have the app on 5 devices and all of them randomly pause ONLY 1 OF THE SHOWS I WATCH BUT IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME. came to rumble because of the youtube shenanigans. Well rumble is playing the same shenanigans so peace out girl scout im done with you
210,"Rumble never keeps track of the videos I've watched or where my point was in the video when it constantly takes me out of the video. My subscription channels never show up in my feed. The screen locks, and I can't do anything with the video unless I just close out of the app and reopen. Then, of course, I have to look for the video and the point I was watching up to. Not to mention the constant buffering while watching videos."
211,Fantastic APP has many channels that informs us the truth
212,"It's extremely barebones. I think that's really weird considering that the YouTube app is such a great model to follow. The YouTube app is practically perfect except for how they organize the comments section. It needs to be displayed as a tree like with reddit. Make the rumble app more like the YouTube app. I got notified that people replied to my comments, but when I went to click on the notification it took me to the person's profile rather than their comment. Please add ""watch later""."
213,"Need an update that allows phone browsing while streaming app. Picture in picture would help. This app as of now is an either or, kinda app. If I have to check email or another app the Rumble app needs to be closed then reopen at the beginning of video. In other words you lose your place in the video. Other than that love the content you allow on this platform."
214,You need to force stop or reboot phone to quit. It has no permissions so what's it doing?
215,I deleted this app because I found out it runs even though if you force stop it
216,Awesome salty army
217,"I love Rumble for the freedom of speech platform. That being said, this update makes my screen flicker and few seconds later pops me out to the home screen. I can not open the app?! Got to a login screen twice before being booted off in the 2 hours? Edit: Have to login 2 or 3 times before it allows me into my account? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Edit: No problems at all. The updated version is now better than YouTube. üëä"
218,"Untrustworthy app won't let you delete your personal data it collects, even refuses request. It Interferes with other apps and locks on screen disrupting other apps. I have had to delete it."
219,This app sucks. Beyond buggy and freezes.
220,New phone app stinks
221,Why bother having a search function if it doesn't work? Always no results for every search.
222,Why does it require you to sign-in? Wouldn't more people adopt it if they could use it without obligation?
223,It worked great for the first couple of months and now it won't even open. Emailed support and got zero help.
224,"Worst YouTube Alternative. Website version is better. However, support doesn't reply to emails. I don't see this lasting until real changes are made. Whoever is in charge of App development needs fired."
225,Great
226,"Andrew Tate needs shares in this company , if it wasn't for him I wouldn't know nothing about this app"
227,Won't cast to my tv anymore stops playing constantly on phone and turns screen white Android 13
228,"Worthless. Except where rumble knows me better than i know myself...when i think i want to watch one video, rumble knows that i am wrong, and will only cast the one video i never even began watching. No matter how many times i stop casting that video, or that i select any video but that one, rumble will still cast the video that i never wanted to watch.... Rumble, you are so smart. Please fix your app, it is unusable in many ways."
229,It plays a different video than the one I choose. Haha. For real. I can't choose the videos I watch. Amazing glitch.
230,"Thankful for the free speech app. Glad to have such great content creators. I understand growing pains. Since last update screen won't stay on& times out with device screen timeout. When casting , casts a totally different video. Last update June 8 wrecked this app. Android user"
231,"I had to write a review after you updated the app.. IT'S SO MUCH BETTER. I used to login and the app would log me out. It was so annoying having to remember the password and having to login everytime i used the app. That doesn't happen anymore, so I'm pretty happy."
232,I really like your platform and the fact free speech is still allowed but please fix the little issues and stay true to your policies.
233,Would be great... if a link would open the app... all of the links that I click do not open the app... the links only open the browser version... and the browser version still doesn't have 10 second rewind or 10 second fast forward... Every other video hosting platform DOES!!!...
234,Keeps crashing . I give up. I just downloaded Real Americas Voice app. Go watch Bongino on his website. Go watch Newsmax on their app or screwtube. Rumble needs to hire real programmers. Your being sabotaged and it's sad you're app is not usable.
235,I do already love Rumble but the reason why i only give this a 4 star because when i try to load Rumble the app keeps closing me out so Rumble please fix that problem
236,"Did you know that on my tablet, when i play a video and turn it off the sound still plays and i have to restart my tablet in order to get it to go away"
237,last update won't let me cast correctly. it casts the wrong videos. very irritating. please fix. I will put 5 stars back. I love this app
238,Add watch history and it won't be one stars. Have to be retarded to build a video app with no watch history. Don't say it's there cuz I can't find it and that proves it's I. The wrong spot.
239,As a new platform you're gonna have growing pains. I haven't had glitches and such like other people. Works just fine. When it started bookmarking videos that was a big plus. Can you look into a default play speed setting. I recently started 1.5 speed on everything. Be cool if I could make that a setting instead of having to click it on every individual video. I watch a lot of podcasts
240,Best Media Platform!
241,App could use some fine tuning it'll play then stop n resume playing with multiple audio n then you gotta restart the app n lately it just opens n recloses redownload it few times no luck please fix this
242,YouTube sucks rumble rocks
243,"I tried to register the account but Select Birth Date field would always stay empty, and the registration wouldn't let me proceed."
244,Thank God there is freedom of speech and expression here absolutely!
245,Awesomeness!!!
246,This is the best Free place to watch Extremely high quality video Documentaries I absolutely love this website
247,Free speech is worth it
248,Its free and works
249,Make rumble available on all concole and pc apps.
250,"Terrible app for Android TV. It doesn't save my spot, it shows low quality video half the time, and it logs me out regularly. Step up your game if you actually want to compete. It seems we have to sacrifice usability in order to see content that was mainstream only a few years ago. Edit: It logged me out again. I don't think they even try. The search sucks, and the suggestions seem random. Ugh."
251,Amazing now just do something so I can back to a channel or search and have it play at the bottom or top. But love that I can play it in the background and I wouldn't be mad about some ads if you can add some of those things
252,Better than YouTube
253,Fantastic
254,app keeps crashing üò©
255,Got it for Power Slap and can't find it till the next week. Unbelievable.
256,"this app has awesome content but the app itself is GARBAGE!! there are too many issues to even detail and if I was a dev on this app, I'd be so so so so ashamed of the garbage work on this sad app."
257,"We need rumble on Sony tvs or all TV's please!!! Free speech! Download it, screw youtube twitter and facebook! Replace YouTube!"
258,"Awsome app,best free speech platform period"
259,"So many podcasters are switching to this platform because of restrictions on other places to put their content. This app is so glitchy, doesn't run in the background correctly, closes itself causing you to have to restart from the beginning, or try to fast forward to where it freaked itself out and closed. If you are truly supposed to be the free speech alternative, fix yourself or I will have to deal with the other platform just to be able to get most of the content I want without the BS"
260,Keeps crashing on opening.
261,Who came to watch Andrew Tate Interview üî•?
262,"Great app, but video quality cant be changed. Always stuck on auto. Video always grainy even with high speed internet."
263,Love rumble
264,YRU.856.N!‚Ç¨
265,The app always forgets my login info. It's a pain trying to figure out which email I used.
266,Background play only works for short periods of time because the massive amounts of data this app uses to play anything. So frustrating trying to get consistency from these apps.
267,"Getting better - can vote again and I like the free feature of opening other apps while listening to Rumble channels. Also no commercial interruptions while watching videos! Most importantly, it's refuge for free speech whereas YouTube has become a total dictatorship! I do look forward however to features that can save favorite videos to lists and a history tab. TY"
268,Still learning the layout but content is tremendous
269,"Love the content. The app works almost as well as YouTube. I said ""almost"". still got some ground to cover, but for a smaller team fighting the overlords to get us content that isn't filtered to provide a narrative that is beneficial to very few people on this, it is a really good app."
270,Can't view unless you sign up do deleting üëé
271,"The app keeps getting better and better. Hopefully playlist capability is coming soon so you can refer back to videos when needed and a 'watch later"" list. Then this app beats ScrewTube! Do that and its a 5 star app!"
272,I love it!
273,Terrible interface. You're FAR better off using a browser. The people running this app are morons. Absolute tool bags. You cannot access your account settings from the app. How retarded is that? Do not waste your time with this cr-app.
274,"6/11: GalS21 - still no car .ide, no lock screen controls, this is embarrassing. It worked 6mo ago. 5/21/23 - still no car mode, still no lock screen controls, app stops after 2 min when scr is locked. 3/21/23: The app is crashing after 3 min if it's running while the phone is unlocked. Is there a zero ‚≠ê rating? Original: This app was better before the latest update. Car mode seems to have disappeared and now when I lock the screen their are no controls and the video stops about 3 minutes later."
275,"I love what the platform stands for, half of who I follow are migrated there. Update: bugs still plentiful. But others fixed. However, the comment section is atrocious. If you take too long to type, it won't post your comment and it won't let you repost the same comment even though it didn't post. Wish your replies would notify you while opening said comment to see who replied. Also make replies like Twitter, allow drop down for other replies so we can see other commenters."
276,Youtube censorship sucks and Rumble keeps crashing.
277,"Getting better; can't remove spam followers 6/2023. Love the alternative to marxist google-youtube. Can't get rid of troll followers. Control buttons are too close for me. Constantly reloads when using hotspot. Keeps telling me to log in to like, when l have"
278,Enjoy watching real people with real news
279,What happened to the green boxing glove at the top right hand corner of the screen on Rumble!? I always used that green boxing glove that the top right hand corner of my screen on Rumble. I hope Rumble puts the green boxing glove back at the top right hand corner of the screen on the Rumble app.
280,crash capital of apps
281,Da Bomb .... but no pip. Bo who !!!
282,"Since this updated last night, it has many issues. Screen locks up to where it becomes unresponsive to any touches. The only way to stop this is to force stop the app. I don't want it to autoplay videos. Which it now does. I'm ok with it turning to landscape when I turn the screen, but not ok when I go back portrait view and it becomes a small, PIP-like view that, again, I can't get out of unless I force stop the app. Fix these and other issues from other users, and I'll re-evaluate."
283,For TOP G
284,Does it work? Keeps logging me off. Won't accept email or password? Will not send me verification email? Just impossible to use too bad so. Goodbye
285,Screen won't stay on playing content! With new update!
286,Great app but needs improvement
287,"First five tries to use, gave up trying to enter mandatory birthday. Google sign-in finally permit me to enter the apparently forbidden rumble zone."
288,cause fk censorship
289,"This is the best live and video app for free speech.RSBN (Right Side Broadcasting Network) on Rumble shows all Trump rallies, speeches and shows live and recorded. YouTube censors them. Let freedom ring. God bless America. Must have app for Trump fans. #Trump #MAGA #LetsGoBrandon"
290,"Great content. But so many technical issues. I love the idea of an alternative to YouTube, but often I give up trying to watch videos on here and go back to YouTube."
291,Great
292,The latest update makes this app way better. Awesome!
293,I'm here for tate
294,Love this app. Features get better all the time. Keep up the great work
295,It's too bad not able to sign up with new account
296,It's good. Great Social app programmed by Er. Andrew Tate. Love you all tate team for building incredible matrix breaking app.
297,The way this works doesn't make any sense. I think your system needs to work better with Roku. It keeps logging me out.
298,Amazing
299,"Hey rumble, no videos will play on your website. How are you so bad at this?"
300,I love Rumble. I can listen freely to my favorite podcasts.
301,Used to use it all the time but can't anymore for 2 weeks whenever I tried to open the app it would just automatically close
302,"I like the app, but it could be improved by allowing videos to start playing where you left off. When I have to close out and come back later to finish watching, I have to fast forward to find my place because it starts over from the beginning again. YT has the finish watching feature I'm referring to."
303,Very informative less restrictive
304,player doesn't go away when i close the app
305,Please make a way to donate to streams and people on mobile. Thanks
306,Kills the phone battery by keeping the screen on even when playback is paused/stopped/ended. Back to the better client - Brave Browser!
307,Real news my news only!!!!
308,five stars for the top G
309,Good for viewing content you can't get on YouTube.
310,Why would you remove the rewind 15 seconds option seriously you're supposed to add features not remove them. *Edit they added back the rewind 15 second feature really happy with that changed my review to 5 star to reflect that change.
311,App keeps shutting down all of the time
312,I LOVE JIDION
313,"Really horrible experience on my Samsung Note 20. Lots of bugs in this app and each update (3 over the past 2 weeks) just keeps making it worse. The app is over-sensitive to the phone position and continously rotates the screen then crashes. Even when minimizing the screen, the app will still crash. The good news? Developers added the 15-sec rewind button back in. #SmallWins"
314,"I will continue using this app for the content, but does the app suck for everyone or is this some orchestrated effort to not hear the information, bc multiple times per episode try to listen to, rumble shuts down and I have to reopen the app and find where I was in the episodes. It's infuriating. If this didn't keep happening, 5 stars would be given."
315,"love rumble but...... great job fixing the UI, such an improvement. now, could we please have a block feature. I know, I know, it's a free speech platform, but I don't want to stop them from saying stuff, I just don't want to read the same religious quotes and versus over and over. keep up the good work"
316,"My original review was fairly critical of the apps functionality. I'm updating my review because they have been working on some of my biggest critiques. Still more to work on, but the app is really improving. Keep up the good work."
317,Better than YouTube 7 days a week and twice on Sundays üëçüôèüá∫üá≤
318,Keeps crashing when signing in
319,Amazing app. Tip: multiple accounts feature
320,Wow what's the problem with your new thing about pairing to a device. Why cannot I just sign into the software. Like it was in the first place. I don't want it paired. Guess I will need to continue to watch YouTube because I cannot watch rumble on my firestick
321,Needa some work but more based than YouTube
322,I see this platform as a direct competitor to Youtube in the coming days. As long as they keep improving.
323,Kind of annoying when I am watching a live stream and I have had to rewind some and then the stream stops and I get cut from watching where I was. Then I have to find my spot again and wait for the video to stop. Also the experience for a z fold could be slightly better.
324,"The devs have finally got the app working very well. I actually prefer it to the function of the YouTube app now, and this one actually has freedom of speech."
325,"Why do people think they need to fix what isn't broken? Now somebody has messed up how it Turns to full screen. Whoever the new person is who has the big head, STOP FIXING WHAT ISN'T BROKEN!"
326,I've been trying to watch videos on my phone and pc for a while now but it does not work. Keep buffering forever.
327,Terrible quality app.
328,It lit
329,By Andrew Tate
330,Not working for vivo v11 pro phone.. Keeps crashing all the time when I search
331,Won't let me register. Red flag...
332,"Now crashes w/EVERY SEARCH üò≠ Update: Cannot even comment most of the time now üòï. Though the ""driving"" mode is MUCH improved ‚úåÔ∏è ... love the app but you should be able to edit your comments!! (Better with every other update! Huge fan!)"
333,"Pathetic quality platform. Verified my account, but wouldn't let me do anything as it was telling me account is not verified. I went to reverify - account has already been verified. Immediately closed account. Will never be on Rumble."
334,"EDIT: you have earned back 1 star. now add functionality of being able to open unlisted links in the app and you will earn another. if you don't, I will still assume you are just another grift platform to throw VC money at morons until you go bankrupt."
335,"Update: somehow rumble has gotten even worse. 1. Constantly unsubscribed from channels. I'll sub to roughly 60 channels, and a week later I'll only be subbed to 9-11. Which ones stay subbed changes each time. 2. Can't type a damn comment. Every single letter I type causes the keyboard to go away. 3. My feed is filled with channels ""like"" those I sub to and not the actual channels I sub to, it's why I barely ever log in to check. 4. Notifications are sporadic."
336,"NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME‚úì WHY are you FORCING my logoff & MAKING me enter password!!! You realize I have HUNDREDS of DIFFERENT passwords! | List of subs displayed is limited, HAD to delete SCORES of subs in order to access ones hidden by insufficient buffer(?) to hold them all. Haven't counted, perhaps 20 subs max B4 they start vanishing.."
337,"The idea of a video platform that's less censorship oriented is awesome. Unfortunately the app is not very well made. OK so now they're trying to litigate at competition. That's unacceptable especially if they're trying to be a startup youtube competitor. The app is still not up to snuff. The site is great, the idea is fantastic, the execution needs work. Edit, it's better, still crashes and has trouble"
338,App crashes a lot
339,"Update As of 06/05/23 - HORRIBLE- if you don't have AMAZING SIGNAL IT CUTS OUT EVERY 1.5 SECONDS. THINK YOU CAN PAUSE IT AND LET IT LOAD? NOPE! ONLY WILL PLAY IN 720P AND WILL NOT ALLOW FOR YOU TO CHANGE TO LESS DETAIL SO YOU MIGHT GET BETTER STREA.ING. YOU, THE USER, HAVE NO CONTROL... IT IS ONLY AUTO FOR QUALITY. DUMB. Fix this rumble or I won't use your service. Listening to two words, a popping click sound and then a pause the 1 1/2 words then a popping click sound,make video pause and load"
340,The app sucks. Just copy YouTube.
341,"What an absolute cluster F of an app. It's been more than a year and they still can't fix their verification system. You're not allowed to post comments unless you verify your email. They send a verification email, you follow the link they provide and you get an error message saying ""there's already an account associated with this email address"". ?????? Yeah, I know. I'm trying to verify it so I can make a comment on a video. ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°"
342,I put my actual correct information in and the app never accepts it. I have to go on the actual website to have it. I've even changed my password and immediately went to the app and it still doesn't work.
343,Run in background????? I love the free speech of Rumble but this app is bad. I cannot get it to run in the background. EDIT 6/5/2023: Running in the background is now a feature but this app is so glitchy. It's almost unusable.
344,Often hangs at the end of a show and needs a Force Quit. Background play and casting are nice features.
345,"Good app but they need to add in option for subtitles and add a option to filter a followers page (most popular to least, longest video to shortest) newest to oldest is how it's already setup."
346,"Reading the reviews was a good time. I Love the low ratings posts, especially the mental break meltdowners. (INSERT "" Wah Emoji"") (INSERT ""worlds smallest violin meme"") Such hardships. These Trials and Tribulations of life are excruciating. I have to wonder how we survived without remotes in the beginning times. Before the internet even, (can you imagine... no way to log into anything because nothing was there yet. No remotes even for years, unless you bought a fancier TV."
347,Since the last update app keeps closing very irritating please fix this.
348,Its good..but i hope future upade have cc
349,Good platform with great standards of equality of users. Developers are working toward making improvements in have of agp which I greatly appreciate
350,Supa
351,"Really want you to win, It seems to have struggle being stable. Unfortunately, you can't watch a video on the background. While in the app, it randomly plays won't want a phone call if you pause it during a call. I really want this to be successful as it's good to have an alternative."
352,For the past week it keeps crashing. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. I cant even open it sometimes. What did yall do?
353,So far its the best!! God bless our free speech platforms thanks Mr Rumble and thanks Dan!
354,"Never stops running. Even when u close the app, and close the application, u have to go to ur setting to force stop it from running. This is the only app I have that does that. And if u close the app(swipe up and remove it from ur active apps) audio doesn't stop. If u play a YouTube video, rumble doesn't stop. Love the app, but it's has some serious fault, minor, but very annoying."
355,"Many improvements have been made over the last year, and especially the last few months, making the app way more user-friendly: Changing the Rumble button to the more recognizable thumbs up and thumbs down. Making it possible to pause and rewind live streams. Adding a ""memory"" so long videos can be restarted where we left off. Just to name a few. And now pausing is back to showing the paused frame, AND the jump back 15 seconds icon is back on the screen, as promised. VERY HAPPY! :)"
356,Please enable the download option for videos like YouTube.
357,"Hi, can you help me in changing my username? I would like my current username to be replace by the username from my banned account. Can you help me with this?"
358,Because there is no censorship here
359,Downloaded this app just so I can watch THE TOP G üëëüêêüíØüíØüíØ
360,A new rumble user
361,I can never get through a whole video without it freezing every 10 sec. This is ridiculous i love the people on the app but it's not worth using it if i cant watch anything on it.
362,Force closes when not connected to wifi shut down mid video. It takes me three days to watch hour long videos.One of my favorite content creators is on here.please fix
363,"With no ability to edit, delete, or use copy and paste, making posts and replies for a dyslexic person makes using Rumble very tedious and outright annoying. Rubble needs to take into account that people make mistakes and need the ability to edit and delete for decent communication to correct mistakes in punctuation spelling grandma and simply having the ability move a post/ reply to the intended location. Simply put Rumble needs to be more interactive definitely when it comes to writing."
364,"First I needed to post a couple of replies in quick succession, I then get a balloon telling me that I had to wait 20 seconds in-between posting replies, so I waited. Then I tried to post the reply, it then told me that I had already posted that comment! But I needed to post the same comment to two different people who asked me exactly the same question, Rumble you have serious problems. Didn't you guys ever stop think about this? Replying on Rumble takes to much effort, needs to be fixed."
365,Love this platform they care about their creators
366,THANK YOU so much for fixing the paused thumbnail issue. I almost went back to being exclusively on censortube.
367,Could you please work on the video play back? I use Rumble to watch long format content and the app always closes and looses my spot. Besides that I love all the improvements you're making to the app. Keep up the good work
368,Good app but the seek bar sucks and why would you leave out a rewind button and a button for pop up player. It doesn't make sense. If you want people to come over from youtube take a look at their feature and utilize them in rumble. Thanx *Edit: rewind is in the new update so i added a star. Thank you
369,Rumble can't buffer worth a sh|t!
370,Billing support doesn't reply. Chromecast icon is always greyed out while properly connected to home wifi and other apps like YT/Hulu can cast just fine.
371,"Could be better, here's how: 1 wherever o pause the video, it needs to reload again, so annoying. 2. it buffers more compared to other platforms. 3. the video quality option gets stuck and only shows 2 resolution options even though the video is 1080p. 4. The video player is just bad. There's other things i could criticize but these are my main, i use rumble everyday and i think Android users deserve better. All the luck Rumble!"
372,"the best and most unbiased social media playform. Unfortunately, I think google Play has shadow banned this app. Every time I type rumble in the search bar, it is nowhere to be seen. I arrived here via a link on google chrome."
373,"app would stop live stream at random, sometimes live won't show up, and If I lock my phone and only listen to the stream it stops after 5 minutes"
374,A chef's kiss
375,Was a good platform but deleting because it wont open on my device any longer so goodbye.
376,Bugs and glutches. Videos skip? Youtube is not doing that
377,Free speech for tate
378,"Rumble, the only online site where the truth is allowed. üòå‚úåÔ∏èüëç"
379,"Doesn't work anymore. When I open the app I get a message that says ""Rumble has stopped """
380,We need a platform like this that will stick up for freedom of speech And the right not to be censored.
381,"Do you have to verify your email, everytime you want to comment!!??? Your app isn't good. See ya!"
382,The updates have help a TON
383,"if you require low resolution, do not update. do not."
384,App is making some great progress. Can't give 5 stars because you censor certain words in live chats still.
385,It's rigged just like the other platforms. Either be a gross divisive argumentative person or don't get views.
386,Very good still trying to figure it out.
387,"Absolute garbage, you guys fix one thing and screw 10 other things up everytime you come out with an update."
388,I love Rumble as an idea but it needs work had to uninstall it
389,"Went from 4 stars to 1 in just a day. You're supposed to be a free speech platform, yet you don't allow us to post profanity in the comments?! That's pretty hypocritical. **edit** Just found out it's a Canadian app, so that makes sense. Canadians have about as much freedom as an English man speaking out against Islam. I knew it was too good to be true."
390,ZERO stars for violations of the 1st amendment because the internet was made with taxpayers' money and is public domain. Blocking non-violent meassaged of true accounts IS WRONG.
391,I love the ideology of free speech that the app promotes and I will continue to support it. However the infrastructure has a long way to go. I constantly deal with buffering issues while trying to listen to a variety of shows. It does seem to be getting better but is still not where it should be. I'm hopeful they will continue to improve and I would be happy to increase my rating.
392,"1. My live chat does not work at all, though I know it is working for others. 2. When I know a live show is scheduled (ie. Kyle Seraphin Show) it won't show up. I will keep restarting the app, and by the time it shows up, the show is 30+ minutes in. 3. When I am listening to something, the app randomly closes."
393,"Needs improvement. Through Roku, my subscriptions don't show up for timely live play. When I join a live, it won't start for 10-20 minutes and just kicks me out if I'm waiting for the stream to start. And why do I have to leave and go into locals to access my paid subs? Disappointing."
394,Tried to sign up several times to no avail
395,"Last few updates fixed allot of major user experience issues. It is still finicky, rotation is TOO messed up in this app. Remove full rotate plz! I don't want a full 180 rotate and it's so sensitive only in this app. Please add better casting support. Add double tap to scrub video and add option to change to 10 seconds scrub instead of 15."
396,Great app. Just not understanding how to use the updated version. Please help. Thank you. You should go back to the old version. I do not know how to use this version and cannot get any money.
397,chat stopped working. all streams. even after reinstall. video and comments are fine. this is a new problem
398,"I'll try to be fair. The chat was working now the new update CHAT doesn't work, and there is no RESOLUTION options. The APP needs a new developer immediately the window of opportunity is closing. The creaters are trying & people are willing. Also cut back on the censorship you start its no better than youtube"
399,keeps crashing
