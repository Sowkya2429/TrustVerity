"Seems to be slightly improved, but with this latest update Bodybalance is missing from the switch workout options. Does not work well for tracking workouts in plans. When trying to switch a workout most options load blank."
don't pay for a gym. get this instead.
Please make the play/pause button bigger
love the content and variety of workouts!!
What's gone wrong?? Offline videos now won't work.
Love it! Great variety of workouts. A workout for every mood & fitness level.
"Quite the poor performance from this app. Laggs, crashes, and the incredible variety they claim to have is nonexistent. I was looking forward to the premium subscription, but honestly, it's quite the disappointment üòû Oh well, back to youtube."
I already installed and signed up but I couldn't login
"Generally pretty good, and functional for the end user. However, lately the comments left for each class have been the same across all classes, e.g. step, SD, tone. So its hard to get proper insight on how people have found that particular class."
Amazing app love daily exercise with this.
best workout subscription I have ever seen. meets me at every fitness level with an incredible variety of different kinds of workouts. everything from yoga and Pilates to hit workouts and everything in between
Im seriously enjoying my homework outs...just love that I can do the same workouts that I was doing at the gym #bodypump 123
"Many issues with the app : doesn't launch, stuck on the signing in page, etc. The website has always been way easier to use."
Paid version won'tet you download
The app is great but won't allow me to download videos to play offline or save for later. Workouts often Interrupted by buffering. Please fix the offline downloading bugüêõ.
"Great app, loads of workout plans for all levels. Can track workouts when signed up to a challenge and can swap workouts if you want to. If you want to do your own thing, there's loads of workouts to choose from. If you aren't sure what to go for, I'd recommend a hybrid session as it gives you a taster of different classes. All the trainers are great at motivating you and keeping you going. Don't need any equipment either, but you can if you want üí™üèº. Great FB community too."
Les Mills is the best fitness streaming option out there!
I would like to check this out but it will not allow me to enter my Canadian postal code. The keyboard only gives me numbers for that entry slot.
App is good. Just done have time. Disappointed in the fact it is not easy to cancel. Spoke to someone in chat and they said it was cancelled but still took money out a month last. Not easy at all and took over and hour to actually get it cancelled and it wasn't even cancelled!
App is never synced. For example I've been doing Stronger Challenge for 4 weeks and app tells me I've done 2 workout session. I don't see any point in using this app as it doesn't track properly.
Pay to use. And show you that after you enter personal data.
"great motivation, like having a coach beside me"
The motivation from the individuals leading the workout never fails to disappoint. Makes you feel like your in a real life class. Plus the variety and value the app offers is just unmatched.
"Great app. I use this every day and it's been years since I exercised as much. But sometimes I am unable to play the workouts on my phone which I then stream to my tv. This means I need to find something on YouTube to do a workout. Please fix as I pay for this, love it, but need it to work consistently"
suddenly can't play videos
Videos won't play
"Love this service and the app is great. It would be cool to be able to 'mix and match' my workouts pulling together my own class based on choosing sets from a variety of classes, if that makes sense?"
"Absolutley amazing app easy to use, great exercises, addictive, fun, great community on facebook, really helps with health and fitness. Bodypump, combat, attack , sh'bam, and rpm are my faves highly recc"
Best workout app...EVER!
"Great workouts. There's a workout for everyone. Great app. It's easy to use and understand. Great Facebook community. Supportive and motivating group of people. I just love LM. I don't know what took me so long to get here. I have tried a few other workout apps. LM is the only one that keeps me going. There are workout plans for every level. Each workout is broken down into different tracks( strength, cardio and etc) and length for different focus. The presenters were great in the workouts."
Makes you want more
"I try other apps but I always always return to Les Mills. Great results, variety and good value. keep the new releases coming please üëç"
"Enjoyable app, great variety of class types, durations and levels, liked the intro classes showing you the moves."
Easy to download classes to work out on vacation.
The best training/excersing app ever!
Tons of workout choice at a decent price.
"Brilliant addictive workouts, I struggled to start using the app. In fact the whole first free month went by and I watched 2 workouts!! However once I pulled my self together I now do 4-5 every week and mix it up with running. I love every different category. I do have to mentally prepare myself to do GRIT as I know I'll feel sick afterwards!! My husband now also uses it. I was worried about at home workouts being boring but they are so much fun and I really love it!"
This app has every sort of workout you could want. The app is clean and organized. Les Mills+ is what you need to feel motivated on your fitness journey.
"12 or more years of group fitness classes & now a couple of years whenever I want to work out at home in a rural location where there aren't any gyms. A brilliant company, I LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è Body Balance & the professionalism of the Les Mills company. You help keep me younger & happier. Thank you."
"I love these workouts, all levels are available. Been using it for 3 years now."
Use daily and am able to complete my exercises. Casting with Chromecast has some bugs that you'll have to learn to workaround with and the same with playing downloaded exercises.
"Overall very happy. But, I would like to be able to download videos to my laptop instead of just my Android phone."
Great app - wished they added more classes as I need to repeat all my classes. Please add new classes as I need to repeat the classes. I loved the boot camp but you took down the classes so I could not finish the program.
This has been one of my favourite fitness apps over the last few years and never fails me.
"Love Les Mills! So many options on here to choose from - cycling, HIIT, step, weights, low impact, stretch, yoga, etc"
Great exercises but not possible to open the app and to use downloaded video when offline. Not useful if you have no internet for some time
Enjoy the app. Just wish you could compile your own mix tracks
"Too many words to describe just how brilliant Les Mills+ is! All the workouts in one place plus extras like challenges, workout plans, limited releases like the amazing Bootcamp Series. Being able to do all your favourite releases and workouts and try new ones is the best part and you can do them anywhere, a good option if you're travelling and need a quick hotel room workout!! It's changed my life and my fitness and I will never be without it‚ù§Ô∏è"
Excellent training! Tons of options and amazing coaches!
"Very good, easy to use app, great way to work my exercise in around my crazy work schedule that changes constantly"
"Frequently crashes, I really don't know why I have to frequent Uninstall and reinstall this app. It's quite frustrating when I'm struggling to get motivated and it adds a 5 min wait on being able to start."
Unbelievably poor app for a coy with so many dollars; just not enough cents. Great workouts when you aren't fighting the ridiculous app.
wow what a platform love this and the variety of the workouts
Charges without permission. No refund offered.
love it ‚ô°‚òÜ
"I have always loved Les Mills workouts, but I love them even more now that I can do them wherever and whenever I want. Perfect!"
I can't update my payment method and I can't log in their website üôÇ
"Love Les Mills. However, I do roughly six workouts a week and, this month, only two days of activity have been recorded. Other than that, I find the app very easy to use and motivating."
"It is a little glitchy when using on pad/tablet as it switches between mobile phone and pad/tablet profile. However content is amzing, and doesn't effect view when you open profile to 'whole screen view'. Love this."
This is a fantastic app. It helps keep you on track with your goals and is well-rounded with its variety of programs.
Easy follow
"App won't even load. Loads on TV, but not my phone or tablet even though it is compatible. I'm so sad."
Was great for the first two months - but now it keeps freezing regardless of how many times I delete the app/reinstall/check for updates etc.
Not as many new cycling classes as expected for a paid app but still a good app and lots of options for spin.
"i love how there is multiple options for beginners and advanced. and also in terms of using of weights they cater for all, thank you team of Lesmils"
Need to fix the following: app won't load when not on WiFi/using data and downloaded workouts aren't playing properly when without WiFi/data either at the moment.
Content great. App is bad. Constantly flickers between portrait and landscape during video playback. Download feature never works properly.
I really enjoy all their workouts. they have something for everyone. their instructors are uplifting and happy. The music is awesome. it honestly doesn't get better than this.
"love the release. like the many instructors within each song, more motivating. Nice change. thanks, we'll done"
I love it at the YMCA. It's even better in an app home!!!! Thank you!
"it's great and motivating to work out to. only gripe is on Android at least when trying to skip back or jump back, unless you use the forward skip or jump, the back skip/jump does not function until after using the forward"
"Love the workouts and instructors, really great content. I live that I can watch my downloaded videos offline. But the app is so frustrating, it randomly deletes my notes on workouts and never saves how often I completed one. The workout plan is a nice idea, but ao frustrating when it doesn't work in the app. I've started adding my notes in separate app."
"Please fix the app, since something happened last time it takes ages to open the app And today it like totally failed to open"
love the Les Mills app! I can do my workouts pretty much anywhere anytime!
Workouts don't stay done if you marked them done 'cauas you couldn't take 30 freaking minutes of jumping.
Dont make thesame mistake I did. Purchased the 5.99 a month version. It has nothing on it. So basically I was charged almost 60 taken out my account straight away and it only has one workout on it everything wlse is one minute or 2 long. back to YouTube workouts for me minus my 60 ¬£. Never again. Why on earth they thought its ok to charge people 60¬£ a year to only get one workout. Scam if u asked me. YouTube is free and more and longer workouts.
Similar experience to other comments. Enjoy the workouts.. When they will play
"short, sharp & e energetic!"
"I like the android app a lot better than the firestick app, but there are some improvements I'd love to see to make usage even better. I'd love to be able to organize my favourites section (ex. separate menus for rpm, core etc. versus mixed) and I'd love the option to hide tiles that I'm uninterested in on the explore page, like kids dance and barre."
well rounded app fitness for all levels and I love the wellness section
"Since the new update the app crashes when rotating the videos back and forth, doesn't matter if the video has been downloaded to my device or in the list. After crash only a white screen visible with LesMills+ logo and won't load. This exist on an old Apple iPad mini and a brand new Lenovo Tab M10 plus with Android 12 on it. Please fix the issue."
Great app. I'm able to Chromecast it easily. The app keeps track of which workouts I've done and which days. You can also make notes on each workout in the app. The workouts are excellent and there are many options to choose from.
Would like to register... but does not give an option... just tells me I'm not a registered user etc.
The cheaper version has hardly anything on it. Only worth it if you get the more expensive price plan but then it'll cost you the same as a gym membership
It crashes everytime when I cast the videos. Can you please fix this? Thanks
A little frustrating I mark my favorite and they are not in the favorite so I have to go looking
"tried the trial then the 5.99 a month option, was awful one combat track in total!! hard to cancel"
the app got much better after few updates!
Shuts down everytime you use full screen play on tablet...
amazing üòäü•µü•µü•µ
"Okay at times. The workouts are great and I like the plans and variety. However, it's really hard to keep track and see my progress as it doesn't keep the progress I've made in challenges."
"Great. I think it is the best. You will be discipline again. With so many plans to follow. As a feedback, fix the bug tocheck the workout done and add it to the average time. Cheers!"
"tried a number of online workout platforms and always come back to this one! Super motivating instructors, great selection of works outs and great variety depending on the time you have available. highly recommend!!!"
Love Body Pump
"Love the different lengths of workout, means I can almost always fit some bodycombat in!"
can only access 1 class per category. not like older version where u can access a library of classes.
"Still a few improvements left Long time user of the previous app here. Good resign overall. Though: -The default search sort is bad - Searching ""bodycombat"" gives me intro classes first. I mean if I looked it up, maybe I know what I'm doing? -The video control buttons are tiny even on my 6.5 inch screen. And the animations of them fading are slow. Annoying to spend 5secobds each time to pause a video. Especially during a workout. Otherwise great revamp."
I wish I could get the app to open on the firestick
best way to workout. All kinds of workouts available. No excuses to not do.
"The workouts are great. The app is a bit glitchly, particularly with screen rotation."
Not really sure how this improves on LMOD? Still no way to schedule classes for yourself and the favourites and the ‚ù§Ô∏è do not talk to each other. There may be a video quality improvement aspect but in terms of app convenience not much to report. Only small improvement may be the lists of workouts that now have all workout length options under one tile.
awesome app
Enjoyed the mix and variety. Time flew by. Definitely got my fill of burpees.
simply the best. The time flies so quickly it feels like you're not even working out!
"I always have been a good fan of Le mills. it was a fever in Brazil 2002-2003. Hard to find a place that offered several options. I always booked RPM, body combat and pump. Now I am addicted to sprint. I do 45 min 2 to 3 times a week, associated with no sugar and no white starch, I lost 19 pounds in 3 months. Got more 10 pounds to go. My body responds well to Le mills training. üí™üí™üí™"
love the workouts
"Workouts freeze, downloading doesn't help. Frustrating and annoying."
"Love Les Mills classes but not this app. Why have a feature that tells you which workouts you have done each month, when that feature doesn't work? I'll do a workout, then check and it is been recorded as done, but the next day it's disappeared. Seems a particular issue with Strength Development."
Love these programs
great
Looove les mills
"Just like a gym class. I used the Sweat app and only lasted a few weeks as it was boring, slow and repetitive. I almost joined a gym again just for the classes but I stumbled across this app instead. It feels just like I'm at the gym. The workouts are fast paced and you don't get bored. Time goes so fast. I love that I can roll out of bed, walk down my hallway and do a class. I love that there's different durations to choose from if you're in a rush. We play on the TV from nvidia without issues."
"Love the classes; hate the android app. Downloaded videos won't play (""no internet connection detected"") and toggling between pages is also questionable."
"The app freezes when trying to cast on a chromecast. Had to switch to screen mirroring to be able to play workouts on a screen. I don't have this problem with any other cast, so I'm pretty sure the app is bugged"
"Terrible app experience! I love Le Mills but app is horrible. Screen keeps jumping around to portrait when device is placed landscape....no way to lock the orientation it seems. Downloaded workouts don't play from the local file,.....the app still buffers them from WiFi!! Why? Won't play at all if WiFi is off despite being downloaded. Please fix these issues"
Play button doesn't work so can't play any workouts
great work outs
Pavkrd with a wide range of easy to follow workouts for every level!
New updates are terrible. App shuts down and you can't open it while streaming and no progress tracked.
The app is crushing all the time as soon as it connected to chromcats. Reinstall doesn't help at all.
The app is so buggy and slow. The older version worked much better. It's a shame because I love Les Mills
It has been crashing since almost a week now. If this takes longer then I will unfortunately end my subscription. I was very happy with it before!
Not impressed with the update - now it crashes every time I try and open it.
"Needs another bug fix. Unless its my phone. Every time i cast a workout, the app exits and when i try again it doesbthe same thing only to tell me that it was closed due to too many bugs in the app."
App keeps crashing when trying to stream to Chromecast. Started happening yesterday on multiple phones.
"I love this app, glad the swapping workouts function has been fixed."
Resets my plan progress every day. I workout using the app on my TV and click in the plus app that I completed the workout. Resets progress back to day 1 every time.
It's full if amazing content but SO FRUSTRATING because in a phone or tablet it keeps switching between portrait and landscape to the point I give up. PLEASE sort this out Les Mills
"Can't use the app on tab s7. I can't watch h any video on full screen, and the app keeps rolling back to the start page whenever I select any workout."
so far so good. smooth and no glitches
Love it! It's been a life saver during lockdown.
Absolutely love it üòç inspiring and professional.
Why do the downloaded videos never work offline?!
Some minor bugs recording workouts but really good apart from that
Love this mix tape Hiit. More please.
greatest program ever
"The content is fabulous,exactly what you'd expect from les mills, but the app itself has major flaws in how it runs. it doesn't like to be landscape, it crashes regularly, and it's slow, making it rather irritating"
"I love the variety of workouts you can choose and the flexibility to choose a workout that fits in with your time frames- choice of 15, 30,45 or 60 minute workouts that can be done anywhere and at anytime."
"Simply love the workouts, the challenges. The easy to navigate app. Everything."
"A lot of problems. Keeps going back and forth between landscape and portrait views, even during workouts. Doesn't react fast to touch, difficult to navigate."
Love love love
"Great instructors, workouts, and music. Great alternative to a monthly gym membership at a fraction of the cost; especially for those who like to workout alone."
absolutely LOVE this workout start to finish!!
"L-O-V-E this app!! I can spin, lift weights and practice yoga/pilates/balance anytime at home!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
App keeps closing ? Any ideas as to how I can get this working please? Have already tried unistalling and reinstalling.
"Switches off, report says it has a bug"
Awesome!!
"I've been addicted to Body Pump for years and between my pregnancies and the pandemic, I am SO happy to be able to workout from home using this app. I have also the opportunity to do some diff√©rents workouts depending on my mood. Highly recommend!"
"The app doesn't work, it doesn't track workouts, meaning if you are following a plan it doesn't track which workouts you have done or not. Also, the download option doesn't work at all, I've downloaded workouts and tried using them offline while traveling abroad and the app doesn't even open without internet. THE SUPPORT TEAM CINISM AND LACK OF HELP IS INCREDIBLE FOR A PAID APP. Why offer tools in the app that won't work and then put the responsibility on the user? Don't reccomend at all."
"Fab, loved it"
Awesome!!
The best on demand workout app in the world! I've been hooked for 3 years.
"content is good, application not so much. but overall well worth it."
"Downloaded the app but I couldn't sign up as a new member via the app. It would only bring up a login screen. Went online to sign up, the site takes me to the payment page and every time it loads it disappears before I can input my PayPal. Just impossible to even create an account. Tried 3 times, had to contact Les Mills via social media (no response). Too much hard work..."
"LOVE MY LES MILLS ON DEMAND! 1000+ workouts to push play every morning without having to go to the gym. I highly recommend the LesMills Equipment. Makes you feel like part of the team/workout a lot more so that makes you push and lift harder. Love the music. It gets me ramped up to stay in the workout. The LesMills Facebook group is awesome. A ton of friendly, helpful, motivated people to keep you going! A+++"
Easy to use and navigate and so much cheaper than a gym membership! Have recommended to all my friends. üëçüèªüí™
I had to uninstall app and install to fix the issues I was having. So far so good.
"I love Les Mills classes. The app is fantastic. The only connectivity issues I've had are due to my crummy ISP. Once I got that sorted, the downloaded workouts play perfectly. And there are soooo many to choose from!"
I love the plans that mean I have a varied and effective workout regime. The presenters are full of contagious energy.
"The new app looks good and is easy to navigate, however many of the track listings aren't correct. Sometimes it's the presenter details and Sometimes its the tracks which are different than shown. Seems to be mostly an issue on the shorter workouts. If they resolve the defects it will be a good app."
love love love les mills. workouts when I want in my own space
"I joined LMOD during the pandemic to continue doing BodyPump. I'm so thankful I did! Not only have I been able to continue a program I love in the comfort of my home, but I've come to love SO MANY MORE Les Mills programs. Pump, Core, and Balance are my perfect combo! Get off the fence and join the party!"
"I think it's better than at the gym. I can choose any time, any class I want."
Won't let me register
Good workout
A great app easy to navigate through all the Les Mills programmes.
"Pixel 2 the full screen loves to shift back to portrait, then back and forth, I have to manually set it back to full screen landscape then it shifts all over back to landscape/portrait causing me having to stop mid workout to try and get it to stay in full screen(even happenes when I lock my phones rotate setting). I only have so much time at my breaks so it's very frustrating. Can you guys maybe implement some sort of full screen lock üîê? Only thing that seems to help (sometimes) is ful restart"
"Glitchy as hell! I've just downloaded the app, on my fire stick it works fine but on my phone hell no. I can't even open the plan page without it freezing and trying to load constantly!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE BODYCOMBAT!!!! IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN DAN, RACH, MARLON , ERIN"
This app is so embarrassingly bad.
"Having auto rotation issues overriding full screen, landscape and system auto rotate on galaxy tablet disrupting Trip experience On another note, streaming on roku works perfectly. Love the classes, make me sweat."
"Very slow to respond to touch. Also seems very sensitive when moving device, it wants to constantly swap between landscape and portrait, which is annoying for classes that have floor work. The format is great, I love the way the classes have been condensed into one tile and then I can chose my duration. Makes it much easier to navigate. I just wish it worked, it's almost like my device is 10 years older than it is. Les mills on demands works better and quicker, and I sometimes go back to it."
Get started and login button do the same thing. Don't know how to login...
"Utterly useless app. Classes dont show. Menu and searching for classes is not working roght, confusing and plain bad. Did you pay for developing this app? You got riped."
Argh so wanted to try this but reviews show same problems I'm having. It shouldn't be this difficult just to load a workout video. I'm just going to go to YouTube and do a workout for free üòí
"Sometimes I use my tablet, sometimes my phone, sometimes Roku but there doesn't seem to be any sync between the various devices. I started manually marking my workouts 'complete ' only to find the next time I logged in they'd gone - along with my favourites. I really miss the old app and if I can find it in the store I'll be downloading it and uninstalling this one"
Love Les Mills but this new app is rubbish on Android (fine on apple). Constantly crashes and switches between landscape and portrait mode on its own. I've gone back to the old app
I am not able to use the app vecause it wont let me create a login.
There is no wayto sign up for a new member
Both buttons on starting screen lead to Login form which makes impossible to sign up to the application.
Better experience than original Les Mills App. Although I don't download offline videos which could be the reason why I don't see the problems others do. I at least enjoy this over the original layout for the tracking of what classes I've completed and how many a week. I wish I could share my workouts with friends but that's minor. Production quality of the videos is excellent and I can see they've managed to continue producing videos even during the pandemic which is much needed.
Constantly glitching
"Terrible, could not update my password and am now locked out. Glitch means the app sends you on a loop when trying to reset password. Super frustrating"
"I really, really want to like this app but it's terrible. It takes forever to load, the pages are half blank when they load, and workouts don't load or keep freezing. Also where is the option to turn off the background music - I really don't like the music I'm halfway through the free trial and considering canceling and taking my money to an app that works a bit faster. Lesmills please check your app - why so slow??! (And no, it's not my internet)."
Works terribly.Its impossible to find new classes. I keep getting a white screen when I try to use the explore feature. It will only load every now and then but once I click away it's gone and won't come back. Very frustrating. I likely won't continue my service until they fix their app and make it easier to navigate.
Cast the app onto TV then stuck with frozen screen (tried several times). At first thought may be tv but every other app working fine. Hopefully fixed soon üôè
"This beta app used to be great, now I can only get the workouts (any) to play less than 50% of time. Which is frustrating, why am I paying for access when I am not able to access? I have to use my phone and it is not a connection issue. When you go to press play, nothing happens. Every single time. I refresh the app and still nothing."
"Don't rate the new app at all. It's very buggy. Screen keeps changing between landscape and portrait mode on my laptop, quite often the app just fails on me and I just don't look forward to using it. Much prefer the old app. It's a shame becasue the new app does have some new features that could be really good."
"Very stupid app. Unfortunately it's a lot of bugs slow, unfriendly user."
"I just got this app and I was pumped to get into it but, it won't allow me to register a new account. All it says is that I am using the wrong log in details which is wrong."
Won't let me signup. So after trying toget started about 10 times uninstalled this
I love Les Mills but the last update has been proper glitchy - like stalling during workouts or having issues trying to cast.
I downloaded the App and I can't create an account.. Apparently I can only login ü§î
"The app glitches, keeps going from full screen (landscape) back to small portrait screen even tho I'm nowhere near to my phone. The origin LMOD app is much better. This would be great if the glitches were fixed"
Can't register to use app
This app sucks. It's always loading and lots of white screen. My internet connection is not the problem because I work from home just fine without internet issues. Please don't tell me to contact your tech support team because clearly I'm not the only with app issues as evidenced my other comments about this app. I will be forced to end my subscription to Les Mills. Wasted my time the last few days trying to get through working!!! Too bad because I really enjoyed the Les Mills workouts.
Have to uninstall and reinstall on a regular basis otherwise cast controls from lock screen stop working. Poor user experience.
"Useful to be able to throw my workout videos to the TV. Really disappointed with how buggy it is, it doesn't count the number of workouts completed as part of a challenge correctly."
I've just joined your subscription buy very annoyed with the app it keeps getting stuck I have to reinstall it all over again very annoying taking too long. Not happy at all
Does anyone else have this problem that when add stuff to your favourites on the and when you go to your favourites they disappear and when you go to the website the stuff you have added into your favourites are still there?
Terrible app. Can't even sign up lol. These people clearly have no clue what they're doing with their apps.
i just downloaded this app but why i can't log in... there is no option for new user..... how am i able to use this app if i can't log in..
I am not receiving the code when I click on the forgot password option..
Best workout program around
"Good new UI but once downloaded, you'll struggle to play a single session without it buffering and stalling. Reinstalled 3x and all the sessions and nothing improves the play quality. Its like the new platform isn't capable of streaming downloaded content to any decent quality. Not worth wasting your time, you'll spend most of it downloading and trying to ge sessions to play rather than working out. This app gets WORSE!! I HATE IT. Complaint logged with CEO."
Constantly crashes. 45 minute workout can take an hour once you factor restarts and freezing. Clearly not tested and certainly not fit for purpose
The workouts are great but the app is so glitchy. Keeps losing downloaded and saved workouts
"If you're planning on using this app offline, just know that downloads take forever and will most likely disappear when you want to use them. It's very frustrating because I love lesmill content but something is definitely off with the app."
"Love Les Mills, can't fault the content but the app is shocking, just done an update & half my history has disappeared, plans yellow bar disappeared, can't save in favourites & if I try to then the features page goes blank ü§î surely the IT team should be able to sort this. If you contact support takes days to get back to you & it's the usual uninstall install advice etc, but done all that. It seems mainly negative reviews on here, shouldn't Les Mills then be re building the app from scratch ü§î"
"Nothing comes up on the explore tab, and 9 times out of 10 when I click into a workout it won't play. So frustrating!!!"
Can you make a slower app? Non stop buffering even on the lowest quality stream.
Update: Why did my downloads disapear? I never know where I am going to be and relying on those downloads to be there is helpful. Please advise.
"Still doesn't work. Recommendations don't match selected programs, blank icons, lots of issues"
"There seem to be less videos on there than on the old version. I can't find remix versions. And after I had sent an email to the support team, the app stopped working altogether. What is going on??"
I love this new app. It's better for tracking workouts
"Doesn't work offline. Half of the videos I've downloaded won't even start, the rest just stops randomly and just freezes. I love the lesmills workouts but this app definitely needs a lot of work to be worth it."
Sorry guys I've really tried with this app and I can see the layout and workout history is nice but the bottom line is it's too slow too clunky and too unreliable and basic features like downloads won't even work. I've gone back to the on demand original app which I don't seem to suffer any issues with.
"I like the app, but have issues using it on a chromebook. Firstly when installed it hangs on logging in then crashes. Load app and you are logged in, but when trying to watch a video it hangs then crashes. Has this been tested on chromebooks?"

"Not as good as the old App. When using downloaded content it constantly changes between portrait and landscape. Also has a permanent message along the bottom of the screen stating no internet access available. I know because there is no WiFi, that's why I downloaded it! Never had these issues with the old App. Please fix these issues. Thanks."
"Please, please, please bring back the ability to filter by time, the new approach makes it so much harder to select and see what's available - it's frustrating@ Otherwise, it's great!"
"This app is so glitchy. Go to ""explore"" page and all I see is white screen. Only some of my completed workouts are logged, but not all. I don't like that we're being forced to use this new version when I could navigate the old LMOD app just fine."
No FireStick access with this new pointless (upgrade). Need to purchase a casting device now - thanks Les Mills.
"I've been using Les Mills for years and this ""upgrade"" is horrible. It doesn't work on any of my Smart TVs. I can't even cast it from my phone. The organization is awful. I can't believe you would introduce such a terrible product."
"Unresponsive app every other day. I can log in, I can change my favourites with delay, but videos won't play and app gets unresponsive out of nowhere."
Awful. I can no longer do the workouts on my TV as the new app isn't there to download. I can't use my phone as it's saying I don't have the correct subscription and nothing will play or download. Absolutely shocking. Not happy.
"The app is unusable, doesn't work. None of the options or workouts load, the rest is painfully slow and useless...... A complete downgrade from the previous app. Massive disappointment. Also not available on other devices such as Firestick, Roku etc. Les Mills, you've taken a massive backwards step!!"
Layout and content is good. It's super glitchy and frustrating to use. Keeps shutting down or freezing.
"When loading up and selecting favourites or trying to swap workouts it doesn't show pump, combat or grit - I've figured out what blank tiles they are but the words aren't there. Started a challenge, watched all the intro and Marlon videos, swapped a trip for attack workout and complete it but it hasn't saved my progress... should say something like 5 out of 68 complete but says zero!"
I downloaded this app as prompted and it did not load any workouts in the pages I was selecting and kept lagging. So I had to re-download the LMOD app again
How do you filter on this app? It is messy.
A step backwards. Major gripe is it doesn't support landscape mode making it difficult to use on my tablet connected to my spin bike
The content never loads
The new app is smarter and tailors better to your usage habits. However it crashes for me 50% of the time. Feels like some sort of beta version. Will stick to the old app until this version becomes more stable.
"I want to love the app, because when it works it's great. However, on my older tablet it mostly won't work, either timing out on log in, or stuck on a white screen with the logo. It's painful and frustrating, especially when the old app still works perfectly. I've reached out to support with details."
"I was able to log in. Would like to love this app, but the new version (LM+) captured data from workouts I did last month in LMOD, but nothing for the past two weeks. :( Navigation isn't intuitive, and I want more filters (length 1st). Dark screen mode would be a great addition. Also, the option to stream via Roku would be ideal. Cell phone worked ok when it was my only option, but the sound quality and synchronicity between picture and sound seem better with the bigger screen."
The old one works much better. Some sections don't load in this app.
Day 3 of trying to login..have sent the email but no direction on the fix red'd. Still will not allow me to type anything on login...doesnt even allow my keyboard to come up. Just flashes back to login. Glitch Galore.
This app is riddled with bugs. Can't even log in.
It has a glitch so I can't put my email in to log in
Doesn't respect orientation. If in landscape and selecting a category it flips to portrait and sticks.
Who tested this? Can't even login properly. Doesn't register my username and password
So far so bad. Fail at the login stage. Reset new password then doesn't recognize it and won't let me login. Will stick with the old app until this is sorted. Is it because I am UK based?
"Cant even log in. As I opened the app first time an option either to start or to log in came up. If I press start, goes straight to log in page. Entered my details and app just stuck there. I can't even see difference between old and new app and what makes it +. I didn't have + experience that's for sure"
Love it
Can't even login.... App won't bring up keypad...keeps crashing.
"My initial thoughts are: It's got all the stuff I need, plus a bit more functionality than the old on-demand app. I think visualy it's a bit crowded, but I can find everything fine, so not a deal breaker. I was just wondering if there is a dark mode function, I looked in the settings and couldn't see it, if not, maybe next update? All the white is a bit jarring."
"Love the new improvements (history and tracking). It still has some bugs, but overall can't wait for it to keep improving"
"Can't even set up a,new user"
I like the app but sometimes when stop casting it to the TV it keeps playing and can't get the video to stop on the app. Slightly frustrating
"Just signed up to use the app for RPM at the gym. Logged into the app, the video list won't load! Whats the point! I'm at home on WiFi and still won't load"
Love the upgrades from the old app! Having history is awesome
Sometimes can be a bit buggy with playback. But good
"Bad time using this app - seems like it has a lot of bugs still. Crashed a lot and logged workouts Id never completed. Not super user friendly either when following a work out plan as if I completed one type of activity on the plan, it 'completed' all of the repeated activities on the plan. I also couldnt change the dates of workout plans. Very annoying and why I decided to not continue past the free trial."
"Firstly, I love how this app has been free through lockdown and the number of workouts available, however the app needs some work. It's unreliable, sometimes I can't get the videos to play yet I've played the same one a day or two ago, it's slow to load and there is no loading bar or icon to tell you it's working so you press on something and sit there for ages just waiting wondering if it's loading. Also, and it might be user error, I can't find a button to quit the app."
"One star may be harsh, as when the app is working, it's really good. I like the workouts, it's easy enough to navigate. But it's very unreliable. Videos refuse to play, or constantly freeze, or the chromecast won't work. And today, after multiple attempts to get a video to play, i signed out and now i can't sign back in again. So the only calories in burning are out of frustration. I don't have any issues with any other streaming apps, so i don't understand why this one is so bad."
Sleek!
Loving the updated layout! Really love being able to keep notes against my fav workouts and skip between tracks
