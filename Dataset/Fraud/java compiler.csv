It's a simple but great app.
Very excellent
Yrr meri programming sahi thi ganga maiya kasam lekin bahenchod run nhai ho raha tha
Very bad aap it doesn't gets compiled fast it takes a lot of time to compile....worst compiler app ever.....I wish I wouldn't give it any star....😡😡😡
It takes a lot of time in compiling the errors.....Worst compiler ever.....i wish if i could give it half star rating which also it doesn't deserve......
Never used only
Taking a hell lot of time to compile. It takes 10-15 minutes to compile a simple hello world program. Worst app.
It is failure 👎
It is a garbage app you can't even keep a class name of your wish every program has to named main in order to be executed
When there is no error still it show eror pleas try to fix it
It needs improvement because in this there is no square brackets and in a java program square brackets are necessary to be there as well as it is showing a error again and again that main not found main not found and so on . Please do something about it.
Burrapadu
Always gives an error of :Main not found
"Useless, fludded with ads"
Very bad experience..... Needs to improve 😒😒😒😒
It shows error when there is no error. Need to improve!!!
"Worst app ever. Came here in search of other app . But found nothing except useless things . Program never gets compiled . Shows useless errors . Even after hours , still nothing happens . This is not even one star worthy . Very very disappointed Fully waste of time"
Bakwas app program hi run ni hota h
Nooop
"Worst experience using this app. Whenever i try to compile any program, it says that class main is not found even it is defined. It's irritating, if any expression mistake is corrected, it still shows mistake in it and don't define properly what's the mistake. App need to improve."
❤
This nice 👌 experiment is super
I'll try it first
I run the program just copied in google. The syntax had main function. But it shown class main not found. Please fix the bug. It don't show the correct error
A lot of errors
Ower writen programs don't compile only it shows class main not found if we write correctly also please solve this solution
Very useful app
It's actually kinda good lol I'm trying to run a quantum circuit simulation and some other stuff :)
Worst app ever!! DO NOT INSTALL! It's just waste of time. The program does not complie at all.
"Ads,too many ads"
Worst
Useless ..never works
Delete this app 😤
Very bad app quality
Not bad But too much errors
Had to do extra things in my code to run it...still didn't run
ok but not perfact
Dozen
Became worst after the update. It was the best app for coding java before bus nerd update.
Super
worst app ever!!didnt allow to do corrections and is so annoying ..it really irritates me a lot
Very bad experience after the UPDATE... It is much better before the Update in the older version. Hope to see the older version in the upcoming update..
I am totally disappointed after this update because offline compiler has been removed😕 I request you to bring back offline compiler plz 🙏
too much ads
This is literally the worst java app ever i wrote a completely perfect program even working in other device but in this app it just showed a stupid error in literally every line of the program which was ridiculously irritating Please DONT install this app its just a waste of time
The autocorrect is annoying
Worst
This is totally trash
Ok
Please fix your 🪲 bug. When i write a code it automatically write random statement it is irritating me a lot
"problem is resolve , code run perpectly👍👍"
Most worst app I have seen ever
Scanner sc won't work
"Good but also add The INPUT function in it If Possible . By the Way, very Helpful app, keep going and updating it.. Thank You."
"A notepad should be added so that we can copy,cut,paste some code temporary while working with big project. Text selection cursor(actually don’t know the thing name) size should be more big, so that we can sellect or place cursor in perfect place in a word."
So good
CODING IS BEST
No strings
Very bad app black screen error 😡😠
Buffered reader and scanner class is not available kindly work on it
int reverse = 0; int i; for( i = 0; i < 4 ; i++ ) { reverse = reverse * 10; reverse = reverse + num%10; num = num/10; } System.out.println(reverse);. 0341
"The offline feature is good and accurate pls don't remove it, it's make code learning more easier, but it can't run some code like Boolean, binary and and lots more. Please work on it."
Worst app ever not even working single progy please don't download it's not good for evn beginner
Too many ads

Not useable
Bunch of ads
Nice compiler but slow output time
Fu*k this app
It's good
Gak bisa dijalanin filenya
Spit on this app
Malware Trojans
Never use this app again
Very helpful
So good
Please remove the ads. Its annoying
"Its ez to use but whenever i type very fast, it kinda ruins what im trying to type or it kinda just mixed the 2 keywords together"
It's like NetBeans Love it
Nice App To Run Java In your App
"just download for not 24h,the phone say it has harmful virus.."
🔥🔥🔥
This is a Trojan virus
Pathetic.... App requires Internet connection when compiling total waste!
Bekar
"Worst app I have ever used...............................................................................................................................,................................................................................................................................,................................................................................................................................,........................................................................................"
It's have good function for practice 👍🙂🙂
👍👍👍
"The app still needs work. It is not clear when compiling which class is expected to be the main class of the project. I find it difficult to declare other classes within a project without it losing which is the main class and method (even though there exists a main method with the correct signitures sonewhere). Even nested classes seemed to be flawed. Copy pasting correct code does not recognizes it to be correct, which I find frustrating, especially when you are trying demos from the internet."
Good but stupid ads.
This app is very bad
Amazing app
Excellent
I used it for my school computer project thanks for making this app
Great app
Best compiler

"It is very easy to use, but it contains a lot of advertisements, so it is very annoying.Advertising cannot be skipped. So a lot of your time is wasted. You need internet to use this app. Otherwise the program does not compile and run."
👌
Can't input 😔😔
APP is superb. Did programming a lot but too many adds just cant switch between the projects. Thought I could pay to stop the adds but no option to do so. Hence removing.
Best application for java 🔥🔥🔥
Only few projects given in that and few reviews there and that also fake reviews 😂😂😂
It's really a good app ! It helps me a lot in my school projects ! Thanks tech bajao
Very good Java compiler app with free cost. I liked it very much.
"i'm giving the 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,because this very useful App support this App."
Very Good App 👍
Helped me alot
