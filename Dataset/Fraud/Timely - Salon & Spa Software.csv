0,"Zero stars. Somehow, they have made it WORSE. Absolutely a joke. Whenever it's bought up with the team, you're told they are ""developing"" the Android app. They have been doing this for two years so far. Trying to help staff and work outside of my business while on maternity leave is impossible. Will be looking into other software apps during my time off."
1,Absolutely 0 support for the android app. Is literally a link to their website. Useless and painful to use
2,Great app
3,Very please with the services
4,Doesn't work for smasung phone. Disappointing. They should've told me this before I paid for the membership.
5,Timely has charged me twice without a full refund for the first month. I requested for my account to be deleted and a debit just came out today which is beyond fustrating. You're better off with square appointments that actually loads.
6,App automatically directs you to the website so this app is literally pointless if you use a private browser. If you don't have data or wifi it is unusable to see any bookings.
7,"Does not support Android - completely broken app after recent major update. Multiple back-end issues. Devs going down the ""it's not a bug, it's a feature"" route. Very expensive, use another service!!"
8,"Shocking on Android, always freezes"
9,Annoying it keeps asking me to review
10,"Super buggy. Jobs dont update unless i completely refresh the app. If i open a job on the schedule, close it and attempt to reopen the job i need to also refresh the app in order to view the job. On top of that theres a 20%-30% chance the app just crashes attempting to open it. All of my colleagues who use android have this problem. This needs an update to be more android user friendly"
11,Freezes and crashes on Android 13 just like the desktop version of the website. Only happens on chromium based browsers and this webview based app.
12,Android app is less useful than an old potato.
13,"Keeps crashing on android phone after 3-4 seconds. Unusable at the moment. When I want to rebook clients using my phone, it's embarrassing, as they are waiting so long for me even to get on the app. Please can the developers sort this very quickly. Thank you."
14,Just terrible. It's a Web version. Never experienced such a poorly built app from a paid sevice.
15,"Awful after update! Used to work perfectly on Android but since update crashes every time app is open. Multiple attempts until it finally loads then doesn't scroll. Timely team, sort this out please."
16,"Difficult time management. For instance, I can't make appointments specific to a certain amount of hours needed. Microblading 3 hours, I have to put a 30 minute time slot followed by blocking 2.5 hours so it works. Please fix"
17,Full
18,Good
19,Android app does not work. Appointments don't show. Unable to edit appointment information. Lots of issues.
20,This app keeps timing out. Very frustrating.
21,Terrible on android. Way better on ios
22,"Slow, defective, useless! Crashes all the time and feels unfinished. It's a shame."
23,"Like the service, but the app is terrible. Doesn't automatically update appointments unless I move weeks then move back. It constantly starts me off weeks late and need to scroll to the correct week and even on a newer phone is sluggish. Definatly will change this rating when it becomes more smooth and functional. But makes me want to go back to Katoomba."
24,"It's ok this android app, but needs notifications when a SMS is received and customer details section"
25,Terrible compared the iOS version
26,Awesome app
27,Not working properly on samsung phone. Always slow or didn't load anything.
28,Not an app. Just a WebLink.
29,Great
30,"The website version of the app works without flaws, the app constantly opens the play store when trying to log in using a code and makes it extremely inconvenient as to get the app to open correctly I have to force close Timely & the app store before attempting again. This among a few things make it not so user - friendly but would due to small changes could be much better"
31,"Terrific software for running a small business needing all the smarts of an online booking and scheduling system. In our case, a driving school. Designed with hair salons in mind but would suit a range of business situations, from trades to personal services. Been using it for 7 years with great success. Great support if you need help. Priced right for employees working part-time, so no need to skimp. Would say more..."
32,"on Android when you try to open the app multiple times throughout the day, the app redirects to the play store every time. and if you try to open it in the play store the app NEVER loads. so you have to constantly close all the apps on your phone before trying to open it again. please fix this issue because it takes foreverto rebook clients on my phone. other then that, the app on the computer works great and the booking page for clients is excellent."
33,"I don't get notifications when someone sends a reply text so unless I'm constantly checking I often miss messages. I tried turning reply texts off but my clients were still able to text, I just wouldn't receive them at all ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's extremely frustrating."
34,Keeps taking me to this page every time I try to open the app
35,It glitches sometimes... Doesn't show appointments or shows the wrong day...
36,It's barley usable on an android. Just crashes all the time
37,"Functions are good when using app. My complaint though is that it doesn't open properly, either it opens without asking for a pin or it sends me to play store and refuses to open. Have tried using support who were helpful but couldn't solve the problem and just stopped helping."
38,"Awful on android! For months every time I open the app, it opens the play store up. I then have to close both the play store app and timely and reopen timely for it to work. Every other app works perfectly fine on my phone so it's not my phone, it's the app. It works fine on my friends iphone but really isn't android friendly. Lazy error which needs addressing."
39,"Monthly fees are so high compared to other providers! I've migrated from timely now and since then, I've realised how much of a rip off the system is. The app itself is easy to use however very costly when you have multiple salons/staff. When I was using the system, they did not have a POS capability which was also quite annoying."
40,"Horrible!!! Useless with android, after my phone updated I can't check future bookings, can't do anything and constantly times out after 2min"
41,The app is now just a browser. Might as well just use your own browser.
42,Does not work on my Samsung
43,"I'm not sure what has happened this year, but I can no longer book appointments for clients on my phone no longer. I emailed to let them know, told to uninstall and reinstall the app, unfortunately it has not made a difference. I'm currently after 4th uninstall and reinstall am going to try something else. Not suitable for android phones."
44,"After the update it is not usable on my samsung phone. Crashes after 30 seconds. When i try to scroll down it jumps back to the top constantly. Takes a long time to load , half the time it just wont load. I had to buy a laptop to be able to continue using it as i paid upfront for 1 year highest membership. Works well on laptop . I do love all the functions. Just dissapointing that it no longer works for samsung phones, as i would like to be able to manage bookings when im not home too."
45,The Android app has too many glitches.
46,"I'm supposed to use this app for work. We have all Apple products at work and the app is fine, I have a Samsung and this app is horrendous to use on my Samsung. Would be nice if it was usable for all devices."
47,Great new improvements!
48,The checkout doesn't work on my Samsung phone. Also everytime i go to open the app it takes me to play store.
49,"Great Software, the mobile version just needs a bit more fine tuning."
50,Love this app
51,It's OK
52,I really hate the fact that I can't upload photos from my android into the clients files. It's most annoying.
53,"Expensive for what it is, that being said I have an android (Google) phone and it works just fine. The only problem would be that a spot can look open on my schedule when it's really not, I just click on the spot before booking to make sure its empty or taken."
54,Won't let me schedule anything
55,Always have crashes during launch
56,"Cant use android app. Timely is aqesome but they need to work on the android app. Its great on pc and ipad but slow, non responsive on samsung. Its quicker for me to leave the room to check a clients booking then wait for timely to open on the room tablet"
57,Great app
58,Best investment for the business so far
59,"Excellent app and great support. Feature suggestion: the ability to add a ""cancellation/wait list"". Tentatively add an appointment that, when a spot catering to the time needs becomes available (possibly due to a cancellation) a notification is send to the account administrator advising/reminding them off the possible appointment filler"
60,"Android timely is sucks, so different than Apple timely. Very glitch I almost double booked because looking at an empty spot where apparently there was an appointment already. Soo frustrated with this android app."
61,"This app needs a serious update, it is glitchy and difficult to use. For the money that is paid to use and access this program you think they could do better. Not happy with the Android app at all."
62,"The android app is terrible, I cant adjust bookings or block out time in my columns and appointments glitch by disappearing and reappearing, making it difficult to keep track and know if people have cancelled or if the app is just glitching. Also not being able to zoom in or out to see my whole day at once is anmoying"
63,There customer service takes forever to respond. DO NOT SIGNUP FOR THIS. THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT TWICE AND TOLD ME I CLOSED IT AND CHARGED ME TWICE! THEY HAVE CLOSED MY ACCOUNT AGAIN. THEY HAVE A REFERRAL PROGRAM I WAS INTERESTED IN AND THEY WON'T PAY FOR THE REFERRALS. THIS COMPANY IS NOT REPUTABLE AT ALL.
64,The best system. I have been using the system for about 10 years and the improvements just keep happening. It is reliable and packed with features
65,I love Timely!
66,"Love the fact I can log straight in and not have to click onto desktop site, however, the app is glitching on Android. Appointments aren't showing properly. They disappear and then reappear which makes it very difficult to see if/when I have availability."
67,Terrible app looks nothing like the pictures displayed. Not user friendly at all!
68,"They need to fix android version, very frustrating"
69,As a global company I can't see how you are obviously not interested in this app. Your company revolves around everyone have apple products.
70,"Just really slow and frustrating. I avoid checking my schedule until I can get to a computer because it is such a hassle to wait for the app to open, let alone change my hours or reschedule a client. The format is weird too, not wide enough or long enough to for the whole schedule without needing to scroll around. üòø"
71,If a car with 4 flat tyres is deemed acceptable then this app is greatüëé
72,Horrible app for Android the IOS version is way better.
73,good ! I use it for my freelance makeup artist work it has some flaws in some areas. but it makes up for it in other ways. it has some really clever aspects. from allowing to add images. and do invoices. take booking fees
74,"The tattoo studio I work for just changed to this software and the android app is horrible. Most of my colleagues use iPhone and the app looks completely different on there! There is so many things this app is lacking; a calendar widget to see all of your bookings for starters. Also, when you log into the app it says ""Some features may not be supported try downloading Chrome or Firefox"". I already have chrome installed on my phone. It's supposed to be an app? Doesn't make sense!"
75,Apps cant log in... Wrong password but can log in via browser.... Please fix
76,"Its slow, clunky and doesnt always open. Sometimes it signs me out and its just long winded. I have deleted this app and now using another that suits me betrer."
77,Useless. Recently switched to Android from iPhone and the Android version is terrible useless.
78,I don't understand why the app is slightly different on iPhone's than it is on Android. On iPhone's you are able to view all hairdressers at once on the calender where as on Android you can only view one at a time which is annoying to me cause I have an Android phone and am envious of my work mates with iPhone's. Please could you make the next update the same as ii phone update
79,Was a decent system to use but very slow. A new update has just been done and now it's terrible. You can no longer shrink the page to see the week of booking so have to keep a scrolling the page which makes it awkward. We pay ¬£15 a month per person and we have 5 people using it . Will be looking for a new system in our salon unless it changes back. Very disappointed
80,"The perfect salon manager. Having been in the hairdressing business for 23 years as an owner, never has it been so easy to control online & phone bookings, staff rosters, product levels, client messages and bookkeeping... It's all here in one amazing system. The timely team are always there to help if you have a problem and to be fair the only problems I've had are my inability to understand just how much the system is capable of achieving. 100% must have for every beauty salon"
81,Great on iPhone.. Samsung version is rubbish
82,Easy to use Not ideal for inputting client data etc. Needs more features avaiable in the app as use the desktop site more often than not. iPhone app appears to be far more useful
83,"All I can do is view appointments and add appointments, cannot change appointments or adjust times. Pretty useless really."
84,Its ok. Easy to use. You cannot checkout or use POS on this app which is annoying nor do you have access to your set up or stock levels. You're better off just going to the website.
85,"Looks great on iPhone as you can view what the client/customer has outstanding to pay, whereas on an android it doesn't show anything or give you any options like it does on the iPhone app, can you please sort this issue?"
86,pretty useless without ability to raise an invoice. Not app related but really over the 160 character limit for sms's
87,"Limited options, no invocing and payments. useless"
88,"Not great on Android, very poor access to information and option to view calender. Not happy with app on android!!!"
89,"Easy to use, can simply click webpage option to get full access. Have no issues with the app at all"
90,love timely but this app is pretty useless...just the same to use my mobile browser....frustrating not having similar app qualities available with ios
91,Not good on Android. Can't see all the staff only one at a time? Can't reply to messages. Not good for managing a business. Why not make it with the same features as the iPhone version?
92,Cumbersome and not user friendly at all. Does not allow you to accurately view your availability. Can't block out more than 12hours at a time and each block out time has to be entered/ altered manually.
93,"There is no section where I can look up my notes like it has on the actual website, it's inconvenient."
