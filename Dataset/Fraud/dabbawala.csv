Bad service
Dabba app jaisa naam waisa kam
Very Slow service
Delivery charge is to high
Gobar App... Pathetic service ... Stay away
"Worst service of delivery, you can't even complain anywhere,they deliver order after 2 hr and you can't even cancel just have to wait"
"Very bad aap, even order are coming late, no coordination of delivery boy and hotel, hotel also not checking orders. Faltu app ahe, order tr nakach karu, app pn download naka karu."
ONE OF MOST WROST APP JAB BHI ODER DETHA HU ORDER GALT HI ATHA H
badwae hai yeh log
Wrost.app
"This app needs lot of improvements, no filters given, no filter to search nearby restaurants or shortest distance. So many features are missing."
"Had a bad experience with this app, really poor service"
Outstanding And Fast Delivery
Xyz
Not in Pune yet...!
Good
Received our order late.. Yusuf
"Worst app, delivery boys not come at a time and food rates also higher compare to hotel +delivery charge extra"
"worst experience on booking,delivery boy are not traceable,they do no pick calls,they have the authority to cancel your orders as per there comfort ....Not use this app"
Very good service....Price is less as compair to Zomato and swiggy ..
Fraud app hai paisa bhi nahi data our order bhi nahi deta be ceare full
Charging double of the actual price of some food products
Good app
Good app not much promo code & discounts given food outlets not much
When I order the food then I was taking a cash on delivery then 15 minutes later one men call me and said sir please payment online whenever I don't take order of you then I said I can't do online payment then he said sir it is your first order so that's why you pay me online so it is very negative point about this application because large of people choose cash on delivery and they can't payment online because of trust so that's why I will give this application a one star üòê
Faltu apk

Very bad services
Sab cheez par 10 rupes bada he ke he
Argument
Easy and user friendly
Not working ...
Mst. App
One of the most irresponsible service providers. You can never trust them. One of my order wasn't delivered even after waiting for almost 2 hrs. Sometimes food delivered with damaged packing. Highly unprofessional attitude. Big 'No' to this service provider.
"Keep on saying invalid location/ postal code, can not add adress. I have the latest version. I see many people facing the same issue, but no action just chatter to drop mail."
Nice App. Offers Food at Lower Price Than on Other Apps from Same Restaurant.
"Very Nice Food Delivery App, Professional Guysüëç"
Very fast service and best rated compare to others food delivery aaps..
Awesome food and delivery
Nice App to use....
Great appüòäüòä
"App not opening, asking me to update even after i have latest version"
Good serviceüòãüòä
Good app. It is easy to use. Great delivery service. Widest range of restaurant. Really had great experience ordering from this app.
"It is a very helpful application and it is a maker trust on delivery person. Really, I appreciate this app"
"Geniun Food Delivery Application, All elements worked as it was expected and as it should... Good job"
Service is good
Best app üëå
Good App... try it out... you would love it too
No delivery boy available but still order is accepted. Moreover Dabbawala manager doesn't received call. There is no way to cancel order. Pathetic.
"Plus * 15 MB app * More textual so loads faster * Left-right swipe till you find the menu category, then scroll up-down for submenu, makes easy to find and switch between dishes & categories * 15-35 rupees difference per dish in comparison to swi**y and zoma** * UI similar to zoma**, G**gle pay scratch card Minus * Splash screen needs attention * Fact text changes so fast Intitial version of the app, so scope to improve is wide open. Keep it up"
"The experience with dabbawala was terrible. The food was delivered after an hour delay, and the order was not even complete. The delivery boys were in a rush of some sort, and we were not able to contact them after the delivery of an incomplete order, which portrays an irresponsible behaviour. The customer care service was also not very helpful. All in all, the experience was dreadful."
Had a very bad experience with the dabbawala. An extremely poor and unprofessional delivery service. The food was delivered two hours late and that too only partial order was delivered. The delivery boys are absolutely unprofessional and irresponsible. Despite innumerable and repeated calls the customer care executive took the calls after much delay and then too he was unable to help in the matter. The rating is absolute zero.
Very quick service with nice new promotions and offers compared to other competitors
"You've got to be kidding me. When you initiate a start-up, one thing you've to do is offer better deal. And it fails to do that."
It's good I like the app and their service üòä
Badhiya Hai
Very nice offers and app but please make it more easy for users because sometimes OTP does not come
"In which all locations dabbawala exists and how many people are using this app Nationally, whi is the promotor of this group"
Awesome customer service from the team and time to time follow up done by the backhand team and delivery team as well. Good job keep it upüëçüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëåüëå
I had experience with dabbawala is this best application with best service and best guide
Very nice app.user friendly
"Worst food app of Pune, dont order from this...they dont deliver food."
Better offers...and discount compared to other food delivery apps
Very Good and User Friendly App
Ye app assam mai available kyo nhi hai?
Please update your app properly as when trying to apply the coupon it says 50% off but shows you have saved zero rupees on this order I mean how pathetic is that infact none of the coupon worked...need a lot of work on the app..
Best üëç
Excellent
Good service
Home page of app is very user friendly So comfortable And Not only This Service is quite Pleased
"bohot easy hai ordering karna , kaafi accha app hai and offers b acche hai kaafi restaurants k saathüëçlots of good wishes to you team dabbawala"

Very nice app best service

Brillian app and fast services
Very Good
"Wow, what an app!!! I was surprised by the low delivery charges"
"For a new startup, the cost saving aspect of Dabbawala over Zomatos cut throat pricing for delivery is very much appreciated. I ordered for some local eateries through them and they have always taken care of me very efficiently. Timely updates on the order and price is the main point."
"Very user friendly app, in comparision with other delivery apps highly recommended, for quality and service, on time delivery."
Bahot Accha App hai. Mujhe Discount bhi mila...
Perfect user interface. Simple to use Nice cashbacks and offers. Fast delivery and Hygiene service.
Bakwas apk
Brilliant App...
Says 'postal code/zip cannot be empty' when u try saving ur address even though there's no field for zip code
Cannot proceed showing empty postal address zip code after adding the marker and address
Nice app
Easy to use app and effective service with savings.
Good app Price is low as compared Zomato and swiggy Fast delivery
"Very Very High Delivery Charges. This app charges a very high delivery charges, you dont provide any good offers, thats okay with us but atleast dont charge this much high delivery charges. Thats not worth it. If you want to compete atleast be reasonable"
Really a waste of time downloading this app..no options available and moreover they gave coupon which never worked.. useless
"Fraud app delivery charge is 308 rs for an order, it's just unbelievable waste of time app"
Wow very nice app
"Very effective, attractive and easy to use,go Download it and see the difference by your self.......almost equal to the restaurant price and moreover CASHBACK and DISCOUNT schemes are awesome....well it's a bye bye to ZOMATO and SWIGGY or any other food delivery app."
Easy user interface
Useless... It's even can't accept the OTP...
Better in rates terms than zomota
App are not open show error and need help option
Unable to sign in. Its stating that 'oops something went wrong'.
I am unable to open app. It is just loading more and more
‚ùåVery fraudulent aap pls don't download

GOOD TO TALK
Delivery cost is high... though good app for city..

I have ordered throuh Dabbawala. The delivery was on time and the food was very tasty and hygienic.
Nice one üëçüëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awsme service i like it

One of the best delivery apps ü•∞ü•∞
"The guys are super kind and polite, have ordered twice had a good experience. The App is pretty easy to acess."
"The delivery app we all were looking for, here it is! Had the best food delivery experience using this app. Highly recommended!"
I love dabbawala
Sorry to say but many things are not working properly.. Address part is not working completely because of which everything is useless.. Totally disappointed
Delivery was fast and app is very smooth in working
The app started on the commited launch date for logins as people were not allowed to login before it. The app had almost every restaurant available to order from at the restaurant menu price. It also offered cashback coupon on successful order delivery. Easy interface for users. All and all a good app.
Nice app and were fast delivery at our door step
"Absolutely hopeless. In Gujarat, caters only to Valsad, Daman, Silvasa. No major cities. Please do not waste your time and Data on this."
Food ka mood n options to choose from n packages for parties r the sone par suhaga. The best thing I could hv expected from any app
Great App. They offer great service at door step. No complaints. Way to go guys.
"Looking forward to replace sendme, swiggy and zomato... Much more positive... All the best guys üëçüëçüëç"
Best app to order online food.
App was working slow plz make the app faster .. It takes lot of time to search restaurantüòÄ
I wanted to make order but could not do it. Anyway wish u all the best team! Do let us know if u need any help
"I downloaded the app and in the middle of entering my credentials, the session was interrupted. Tried signing up again after a while, but it said that username and mobile number already exists... When I tried to log in, wasn't able to as the password I had entered was showing as incorrect (although it was the right one) and there was no provision to reset the password too... I also haven't received any email regarding the confirmation of my subscription... Please look into this"
