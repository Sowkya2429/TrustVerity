Really an nice app. Thanks dev to develop an app like this
"Very lagg, just like I'm using it at 30Hz! Need to work on it, especially today's smartphones have at least 60Hz screen!"
If I'm opening the app the app continuously loads
Trash
Best complier.
seems like it would be useful if there were a landscape option.
Scamer.... Name is all in one... But don't have fortran programming... Waste my time
Unsatisfying products. It is better to delete this compiler.
"It doesn't work when you click it shows that you click on a language you wanted to use but nothing happens,do not install l recommend"
"I hsvent uded the App yet. I start with 5 stars, and then see how it goes."
"On ChromeOS - updated this morning - launches to blank black with white phone-aspect bar, then hangs app; system not affected."
Very useless app
App does not working
"Doesn't even launch, just a white screen"
If I can choose zero star it would be better ..
Blank screen... Then nothing.
"This app is absolutely zero, nothing works on the app whatever you click will take you back to the homepage."
App is not working.
Welcome to Warner Bros. Studio Lot!
Trash not working
Doesn't work on a Android 12 note 9. Looks like graphical libraries are broken.
This app is not working.😐😑
Does not work.
Enter key doesn't make a line break while writing the code. So I couldn't use this app. Without that Everything was nice.
Stupid compiler doesn't work
Fantastic app!!! I liked it muchhhh 😊😊😊😊
Don't work just downloaded and it said update available 😃 please update also not working.....
This application was good. But there we have one problem in getting input from the user. It's not proper so please alter that with different cases
No working at all
Not working
I inform you about this app after the use it
Not even opening or responding.
Totally not working waste of time and data.
I just want to know why we can't just copy paste? Why??
Need dark mode for whole app. Also no options available to download modules
It not usable but you are genius
Nice

"Though it has many languages, but too slow when it comes to compiling."
