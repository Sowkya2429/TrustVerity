"This app is a scam, fine print subscription for 68 dollars .... for at home workouts that I stated I had no equipment and they included giant jugs of water to make equipment I stated I did not have. Do not use. Just do some push-ups and crunches then pay me 70 dollars instead."
they are thief i canceled my payment but they still renew the payment and steal my money don't subscribe the app they are thief
Bad. Makes it very hard to unsubscribe and the auto payments will destroy you
"Thought I was subscribig to a different app, Also requires payment before you see the app"
"App is a scam, all it does is tell you to contact customer support. When you contact customer support they send a generic email that has nothing to do with what you sent them."
"I have cancelled my subscription and stopped renewal several times and they keep renewing regardless. DO NOT BUY THIS APP, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF WITH THEIR USELESS WORKOUTS AND UNABLE TO STOP RENEWALS. In response to the response from Mad muscle. I did contact your customer service and they said they are keeping my money from the renewal and hopefully it won't happen again. This is B.S. Finally, I am being re-imbursed for the subscription, thank you for doing the right thing."
Absolute dirt! Refunds are non existent. Steer clear.
To low excersise and to much adds if I could I would give it 0.1 stars
Easy to follow and sustainable from a time/intensity perspective
"Shady billing policy, they offer only excuses not to display a clear status of your subscription. I took a screenshot of the Account section. I can't upload here though. No mention of a plan but they still charge me recurrently. I'll have to remove them through my Credit card company"
it'd pretty good
"Very useful app, the weekly program is very solid and it keeps changing week over week.. I just love it... Additionally, they have an amazing customer service..."
"My 1st day using the app was a bit confusing, the standing lunges for example, says 60 reps, it doesn't indicate 30 per leg, so I had to guess, don't like the timer for exercises with reps."
"Great app, honestly. Great recipes, great challenges, and even greater workouts! Best way to stay fit, if you don't have time to plan everything out for yourself that is!"
Not great
Terrible app. Don't waste your money. Always comes up with no internet message when every other app on the phone is happy.
Trash
"Not the best specially meal plan, wanted to cancel even doing what they tell you to do to cancel they will still find ways not to get you to cancel until you give up so no dont recommend it at all"
Great workouts. A hassle to cancel subscription.
there is no rest or change position seconds between workouts.
"I don't like the timing, 1min rest for everything, even when changing from left to right? And it s not skippable. Cool down after lower body workout has chest and biceps and triceps stretch (without even explaining where it should stretch). Fixed time for doing the reps instead of clicking when done... I only like the fact that some tools like bands and weights are used."
TRASH TIME WASTING I SETED UP EVERYTHING THEN IT SAID PAY
"The quiz it starts you off doing is quite good, but the layout of the sign-up pages is deliberately confusing. Turns out the meal plan it talks about is quite a lot extra and I'm not sure what I actually paid them for as the workout clearly wasn't personalised in any way - I wouldn't be able to do half the exercises despite being fairly fit already. Clearly a scam. I'm just glad I paid with PayPal so I was able to cancel the subscription at my end without relying on their customer service."
System has been glitching all day. Disapointing for a paid app. Havent been able to use it all day
suddenly charge for 1 months without confirm.
خرا
"ITS A SCAM THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY, THEY TOOK MY MONEY!"
The app lures you in to give them all your informations and then shows the cost of the subscription
Scammers. Avoid this app like the plague.
"So far, so good. The only thing I do not like is that it doesn't even tell you how much to eat ( like 1 or 2 wraps for ex. ) without paying the 11.99€/month. I think that is a bit too much. They could include the amount to eat with the basic 3 month program."
I wish I can share the trouble with someone because I am new to the app and some stuff I like to share so far I haven't found a way to do it.
"bruh, I can't do a thing without paying?"
Worst app ever
Poor customer service. I was charged for 3 months in advance on the second set as I decided not to use it the first set. They told me I do not meet their money back guarantee for personal reasons and I do not have screenshots or videos proving I used it. Very scummy business.
Careful they have a complete fraudulent publicity. Read all small letter..I feel cheated . There are many other apps that they don't have fraudulent marketing and their return policy is more sencier
Bs
in six months imma be jacked with this
"Make sure you don't get charged unwillingly using this app. They won't refund you even if you missed the dead line by a day. Taking advange of people like that is truly disgusting, Mad Muscles people, should be ashamed."
How come the exercises given for a day is not focused for an area of the body but always full body?
"Very poor app for a high price. There's a limited number of exercises, so if you can't or don't want to do any of them, you don't have many options to choose from. Workouts were neither pleasant nor interesting. A pure disappointment."
"Tried to charge when the subscription was cancelled already. The app is not great. It actually doesn't serve its purpose. In reply to your comment, you may have the TCs available somewhere, which are completely aware that almost no one reads, It would be expected to have the subscription cancelled through Google store, which I did. Funny enough, my bank considered your attempt to charge the subscription as a fraud and blocked it. But I confirmed that it was cancelled at a long time already."
😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
Be careful of this app. It hides extra payments for nonsense pdf documents. It also doesn't let you select the time duration you want to workout. Very strict refund options..! There are many better apps than this one.
"no audio indication when an exercise time is finished, so must constantly be looking at screen. unfortunate."
After lots of information given to them they asking for subscription payment in the end... Ask it in beginning so we can uninstall app and don't wast the time to provide information
Took me to the next level
Bro this app is so stubid it tells you you have to pay money after spending 10 mins of making your plan and its very expensive like crazy prices
No equipment means no equipment. Trying to get back into things and only want to do body weight work outs. I use water bottles to drink.
Impossible to unsubscribe. Tried everything. No assistance from their side. Don't answer my e-mails. Just keep on charging me every month
This app is a scam. I cancelled my subscription last month and they are still charging my montnly subscription fee without the option to apply for a refund. Beware of this App!!
Premium paid app
"This is the worst app and worst company ever. Horrible customer support who will ghost you once you have real questions about their shady tactics. Apparently after being shadow charged for something i DIDNT SIGN UP FOR, i cant get a refund DO NOT USE THIS APP OR SERVICE"
Conned into subscription under the pretext of individual workout plan. It is nothing more than a pre-made demonstrations of basic exercises which can be found online for free. Meal plan is also a separate cost even though it's part of the test to design your plan. This isn't made clear until after the subscription has been paid.
"THIS APP IS A SCAM!!!! Also, their customer service is non-existant. I have tried to reach out to their email (the only way to contact them) 4 times, and no one ever replies back. I bought a subscription and haven't been able to log in to uae it because I never get a security code sent to my email which you NEED to log in. Highly do not recommend this app unless you like getting screwed out of your money and ignored about issues with what you paid for. I would rate zero stars if I could."
This app is a textbook subscription scam model for the app store. They make it deliberately difficult to unsubscribe so they can continue to keep your money. What app takes over three different taps across different pop up windows before you are actually unsubscribed? What a shame
"Trash workouts no way to identify equipment you have, no personalization, meal plans are also trash, decent for accountability but not at all with he money, you're better getting a randos advice on Reddit than pay for this"
"Great workouts, had to reinstall, change start day for the workout to be registered, so up to 4 ☆s now. But now it doesn't seem to sync with Google health and Google Fit, even though it is suppose to. Please fix this bug."
Really good programs .
"Tried the app out, was underwhelmed with the program and found an alternative. On sign up they automatically renew your sub and bury the option to turn it off in the menus. I noticed on my bank statement I had been charged and contacted them asap, but they refuse to give me any refund and instead offered free time. I'm very disappointed with this app/service."
Edited Review: A clear DISCONNECT between the app team and the internal operations and finance department. The respond to a review and ask you reach out but then say they cant do anything. WASTE OF TIME It's a task to turn off the auto renewal and they just charge you. When you reach out to the company (in my case not using the app for 4 months due to an injury) as mention the issue they say they can't refund your money. Use them but be careful and read all the terms and conditions
"excellent program, keeps me fit for doing lawn work with no fear of injury on the job. I get paid cash so it's essentially a good idea not to overdo it. the workouts are beyond genius."
I don't like it when apps ask me to review them
Awesome workouts easy to follow. I do intermittent fasting and with these workouts I am down over 30 lbs in 3 months loving life this is something to use now 6 months in down 50lbs. Love this app workouts easy to follow and feel so much healthier
Workouts aren't very good. Waste of time.
"After 20+ days since I placed a 3 star review they haven't changed a thing. I had hope they will wake up after such an enormous backlash, but it doesn't seem like they are in a rush. There are better apps keep out there away from this one. Their first update was a bugfix with nothing changing to the core of the app. Sad, very sad...."
"The workout is not personalised at all. No time between workout to finish one and get ready to the next. You fill up the questionnaire but your workout ""plan"" dont care about your answers It is wast of money and no way to get back money even they give garanty"
closses the app after click start workout.
Worst App Asking For Money Dont Download or Install
"I registered for 3 months but after one month app asked for making update and after update they asking me to buy again and register. This very confusing l, I sent am email to them and still waiting for any reply Update : I got a reply from support team next day and they follow up with me until my got my account back. Thanks the Alice and the rest of customer service team"
I would like to Unsubscribe from subscription and meal subscription.
This is Very bad app please don't download this app 😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
"Kinda hoped for a good, free workout app but guess not"
They are stealing me!!!!
Because i'm 17 years old i can use the app!!!
I already cancel subscription but still get billed on my credit card. Can not cancel subs on your app!
"The exercises and demonstrations are fine. There is not enough time to transition to the next exercise! Have a count down before the next begins. Something! Also, I'm 2 weeks in and I just encountered a lunge exercise with 4 sets of EIGHTY reps. With dumbbells! If that isn't a mistake, it is insanity. Especially 2 weeks in."
"Food plans are not personalised, exercises are not personalised, the advertisment has nothing to do with the real app. It gets worse when you try to cancell, allnkind of obstacles to cancell. I'm very bery disappointed 😞."
"Wonderful input, follow up and follow through"
"What a joke. Nothing like I expected nor wanted. Their refund policy doesn't exist . Avoid this ""product"" Update. Surprise, surprise I got billed another cycle. No records of my cancel request. I didn't even have the app for 48 hours before I realized this isn't a viable product. They wouldn't refund me for that. AND now they charged me another three months. Nearly $100 to see the app / product is worthless. The fact they don't offer 100% satisfaction should be all you need to know."
I am looking for FOC trial period around 1 month after trial you can charge.
"Repeating same exercises everyday! If your solution to working out and building muscles is to just get off the couch and push yourself for 30mins yes this app is fine but you can get that for free with an exercise program on Netflix -fact is that you'll get a better work out. This app is useless. I got the trial run for around $30 after seeing on TikTok. Stopped using it and it auto-renewed me for a year around $75. Asked for money back next day, CS says no can do. Total scam too!!!"
"So far so good , but there is no possibility to swap exercise to a easier or modify set."
Lots of tasks for unwanted plans
Nothing without money
I thought I had cancelled auto renewal. I then got charged for a month. The same day the charge went through I sent an email asking for a refund because it went through in error. They refuse to give a refund. The company is flat out abusing auto-renewal in order to get more money out of you. I signed up for a trial and first thing I thought I did was cancel auto renew. But apparently not. The company is scummy. I would avoid at all costs.
Absolute trash
"**BEWARE** VERY UNETHICAL BILLING! I signed up for a week, only to be billed for a month after that week, I reached out to customer support the day they billed me and refused me a refund, then stated it was a week trial when there was no mention of that. Unethical company the app is ok but you don't get a meal plan either unless you pay more..stay away from this company! A reply to their answer, it was Madmucle app that denied my refund after I canceled and requested a refund for day I won't use"
I canceled my subscription and you still taking money off my card . I have to block my bank card now because its automatically renewed subscription and there is no way i can change that ..
They will steal money from you. Avoid!
"after did i read the comments i understood that the plan meal is not part of the plan and i didnt know that, so i want to get back my money and stop the subscription. anyone can help me?"
Nice but we are poor people we can't afford the price is very expensive we can't afford sorry
"Not worth the hype. They claim 30 day money back gurantee, but won't return your money. Pulls up clauses like a blood sucking lawyer. Stay away."
Not easy to unsubscribe
It's good but app continues to crash
Not free bad app
It's horrible when the internet connection is poor. Poor app design.. user experience is sacrificed to secure royalty
Not worth it. Automatic subscription in the small print. So far unable to cancel. Get spammed like crazy. Awful.
Does not come up with legitimate programs for advanced athletes and it doesn't refund your money either. Don't waste your time or money on this.
Can't change personal (height and weight) info from metric to imperial. I want my weight to be shown in lbs. And my height in feet and inches.
"This app is complete garbage. Little to no useful functionality, and their screenshots and advertisements are completely misleading. They also make it very difficult to cancel your subscription, and refuse to refund despite any clear indication in the app that you are still subscribed and will be charged. Just another useless scam app."
it works but I wish it could pair with my garmin watch. it also seems like the notifications are random encouragements not actually referencing my workout plan or progress
Don't waste your money you can find work outs like they have in the app for free.
"If you are truly making the choice and commitment to improve your physical health, then this is the app for you. And if you're really paying attention, feeling good about yourself also improves your mental health. Just saying.."
Workouts are soft for my age group. And I can't find out to change that for a more challenging program.
"This company will charge you a 14$ hidden fee for ""additional materials"" for nothing at all and when asked what those fees were or for a refund they will refuse, I would like it noted UNDISCLOSED FEES ARE AN ILLEGAL PRACTICE and as such since I've been denied a refund I'll be getting my money in more legal ways, AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS."
Rest intervals too requent after every excerciseand tpo long (1 minute) how do i customise this..
I couldn't cancel my subscription because the log in didn't work on the website (security code was not sent to my email). I asked them to cancel my subscription through request on the website and it said that my request was solved but they still charged me 40$ at the end of the trial period. I don't recommend this app to anyone because the app is not working properly and they have terrible support. They just don't care about their customers.
"AVOID. I got this app back in Mar. & paid for 3 mo. The app wasn't great. It's workouts are generic & not as custom as their marketing would make you believe. Then I got hit with a $50 bill to my acct (I don't usually select autobill with new apps). I immediately cancelled my service and requested a refund; A refund for a service I have yet to use or receive! Customer Service denied my request 2x, offered NO other options, and they were even patronizing in their responses. Enjoy my $50, crooks."
It helped me to ease into a regular exercise and fitness regime.
"In the ads, they mentioned that the plans would be free with the dietary plans as well. Yet nothing was free. Everything was paid. These types of apps disgust me, and they shouldn't exist"
"WORKOUTS NOT AGE RELATED I signed up for this at 58 years old. Been kind of keeping up. However, to think at the beginning of this program that I could somehow do 90 push-ups or 180 lunges in one workout is ludicrous. The warm up is too fast (e.g. do 5 of each when video shows guy doing 2 or 3 and moving on quickly). It would be helpful to have pertinent info on the 1 minute rest screen (e.g. what is next or how many sets/reps) without having to press the very small tab to see it. Challenging!"
ITS NOT FREE
WARNING. SHIESTY BUSINESS PRACTICES. Bought a subscription for 11.99 a month. They charge me 11.99 +13.99 . I emailed the billing department they said I should have read the fine print.
"I didn't know it was a subscription, and of course, they've billed me for 4 months until I've figured it out in my Revolut extras. And I can't get any refund either, because it is stated in the refund policy, ""we don't offer refunds if you didn't know it was a subscription."" The UI and UX are specifically built like that. Too bad I don't recommend MadMuscles for the way they are treating their clients."
i paid for lifetime subscription but the app suddenly doesn't work it shows no internet connection even though i have a proper working internet. please fix
Liked the app but it totally will not even start now.
"I bought a week plan then they auto charge for a month. Not what I wanted. The support was not helpful at all. No one has gotten back to me. Very disappointed, don't bother with this app."
"Don't use!!! It's a scam, you complete the questionnaire, sign up then when trying to access the site it keeps saying no Internet! When every other app runs fine, surprisingly this app was suggested by other websites.."
"Rip off, just been hit with a 68USD fee that repeats every 3 months. Trying to cancel the subscription but I'm blocked from cancellation while the new subscription 'updates'.....I have to check back 'in a few hours' before cancelling. This is a complete nonsense."
"If you are just starting out or need basic guidance for a few months after getting back into working out this is a great app. As soon as you are at a more advanced level your superset is basically your entire workout for the day 😂. The price is also quite high and there is no free trial which makes it quite hard to recommend to friends. There are also a few key features missing, I.e. If you forget to complete a workout you loose your streak and it's missing things like rowers and ski ergs."
Wanted to gain mass...just lost $
"Useless app, list customisation of workouts."
"This app was good until this week when it suddenly started forcing ads... didn't pay a subscription to get ads forced on me whilst working out ... not happy *update, the ads seem to have now disappeared.. I have no idea what happened. Happy again"
"App takes forever to load, no response from support. Pathetic for something you pay a fortune for."
"I paid for the 3months membership hoping the would help me grow but it's totally not worth it. The app experience doesn't make sense to use at the gym for me it forced me to have either watched it all before I went to the gym or keep my eyes on the screen at all times when working out to follow. This is not practical. Also they say they give refunds but really, they don't, I requested a refund the next day after my purchase and never got it. They just cancelled my membership and kept the money."
"I had this app for a month and I signed up for the 1month no meal plan(meal plan is 10$) and I was charged for 30$, even those it said when I first started it was going to be 15$. Other the. That the apps has good workouts in it. The workouts stop when you close the app."
U have to give demo plan
Need to purchase
"I paid for the 3 months subscription, after 2month the app stopped and ask me to renew. This app is a fraud, they never replied back my emails. Unbelievable"
Redefining Oneself with Mad Muscles
Ok so after 7 days of silence but me sending emails the issue below so I changed my rating. Past issue 6/2/23 to resolved 6/9/23 ( below I listed some issues and now I'm not even getting any response from support at all. Took my 3 months n dissappeard after 1 month.. sigh.. I payed for 3 months and got locked out today and it's only month 2 ? My subscription is not due til August... now customer service thinks I want to cancel my subscription 😑 )
"Dont use this apps as it seems more to be like a scammer apps. I habe already canceled my subscription and you still deducting my payment without my acknowledgement , you should just close this apps down !"
"Probably good content, but the app is annoying to navigate and sends frequent irrelevant notifications."
Perfect
"Cool training program. Currently I'm facing an issue as the ""coach"" proposed a harder training level, I've accepted and got dropped down from Intermediate to Beginner. ""Change my program"" function does not allow to specifically change that selection. Please fix this."
The workouts and breaks are very well planned for peak improved results. The meals given so that one can plan ahead and avoid food deemed as detrimental to your success goals.
This app is treble.. it's not user friendly
App has stopped working just gets stuck on load screen
It is not working it says no internet connection despite there is an internet
Useless.
"The training program can be OK, I have no enough experience to decide it so far, but the App doesn't feel professional for the money. You can't change many of your attributes after the first set, loses track and logs of your progress, and so on. I want to like it, but it isn't there yet."
"The app and workouts are pretty good but the meal plan is terrible. It is not customizable and the shopping list/meal prep is way too complicated and extravagant. There is no way to try before you buy so I got suckered into it before realizing what it was. Also make sure to cancel right away, you'll keep what you bought but if you don't cancel right away they will charge you triple!"
"After downloading, put complete details with long process, then later it is known that money will also be spent. 😂😂😂 then i uninstalled the app"
"Be cautious of their billing practices, you cannot just uninstall the app or deactivate your account, you need to stop the subscription in the app first, otherwise you will be charged again and they won't issue a refund. Also the app notifications are garbage and don't always work, you work out for the day and it still reminds you to work out and unless you shut it off, which defeats the purpose of the notifications. The workouts were OK but not worth the hassle, do not recommend."
I downloaded the app and all seems fine but after using it and getting a personal trainer through a friend I decided to cancel the subscription and request refund.I wrote to them twice and they said they will get back to me but no response.Kindly refund me my money.Thanks
"Doesn't let you track the weight you're lifting, can't add exercises to a workout, doesn't let you add sets to an exercise"
Rates does not give a trial period after asking so many questions it asks for payment first. Which was annoying. You need to have a trial package
These workouts are not good. Will not gain mass by any means doing these workouts. Disappointed
just subcribed and i was hasty. the app doesn't even work on my s23 ultra. whenever i open it its stuck at startup page
"COMPLETE SCAMMERS. I have paid 6$ for a 7 days access, and after my subscription ended, i was charged 30$!!! without my knowledge and consent. No where on the page was written that i would be charged 30$ after 7 days passed. The refund was not approved ofcourse and they tried to bribe me with 3 months free subscription, which i refused and demanded my money back. On top of everything else, the app itself is terrible. Dont fall for these scam artists. I will be filling a report on them."
This is a scam. Do not download. I purchased a 3 month program and without knowledge they signed me up for a auto-renewal of $53. I tried emailing their support for a refund but the email accounts are invalid. The support number is an international number that goes no where.
Paid app Only seeking money
amazing workouts
Their Ad said it's completely FREE but that's not true .. after filling the info it asked money plan to choose and if you just click cancel no workout starts befor buying plan.. false ads false app
Paid BS
Subscription only service 😔. Not recommended for most people
Kept billing me even after I cancelled my subscription.
"I enjoy using the app, I would like to see an offline mode where you can download your workout for the day and do it while you don't have an internet connection. Another thing is the warm up program can be improved to be better suited to the workout at the moment it is just 5 minutes of the same warm up rushing through it not really warming up the muscles that is going to be used, that is my experience."
Bluff
so far I'm really enjoying the work outs.. i bought the 3 month plan and I'm getting addicted... later I'll add the meal plans and stuff....
This app helped me to get back into the gym. This time around I let myself be guided instead trying to be my own PT. I like the build up and I am getting stronger every week. What is missing is the following: - option to add extra training day or moment - there is no cooldown/stretch - there is no suggestion or option to enter the weights you are using. If so it would make the calorie burn more accurate - after 1 month the app told me to subscribe again when I have a 3 month subsc. Logged ticket
"It's like every other workout app. Generic..you can find the information for free out there! Don't waste your money. I purchased it. Found the same information on other workout apps for free, nothing new. Tried to get my a refund when I purchased looked it over and saw it was a waste of money within 1 hour. Edit after they replied: they didn't refund. Sent emails back and forth. Was ""escalated"". Awful. Purely awful."
"Was good to give guidance for beginning, but for the price, they should offer a lot more. Challenges are lazy with too few videos. After an update the workouts are buggy."
"Hello, I did not complete a training program because I wanted to cancel again for personal reasons, but that worked wonderfully with the termination of the subscription. My subscription was canceled without any problems and I received a corresponding confirmation."
Fake
Can you pls quickly solve your app problem? I can't even start off my first workout plan after full subscription of 1 year plan now!!! It's So irritating and disappointed.
they do not follow their cash back policy ever after sending a number of emails to them
It is for one who is self motivated.. I have gotten to my weight loss goal and now that I am done with it . It continues to charge me 68.16 and i don't know how to stop it . I have sent emails and I can't seem to find a way out here
Bad
pretty good app. Pretty pricey for me personally But if you stick to it it works
"so far, I like it. We will see in a month or 2 if I still feel the same."
Great directions easy to follow
Not good to pay for it
subscrition scam--beware
"Warm ups and cool downs are generic. Day 2 on the app, but it doesn't seem like the exercises are the best exercises for the target muscles. Timing is a little weird and generic."
Waste of money. Oversold.
Not worth it and then they auto-charge you an increased rate without refunding your money
Having serious issue in app once we download the workout and start our workout the app screen goes off haven't completed the workout plz fix the problem
"This app workout didn't work out for me, even though I chose harder work than I could handle, yet it's too easy for me."
"If you're planning to refund anytime soon, don't pay to begin with. To start off, there is an auto-payment that happens without you knowing, I got charged. There isn't a refund button option or anything like that but just customer support. I contacted one of the customer support workers and they didn't cooperate much & well at all to view my situation that well. Since it's difficult to refund or anything like that, I had to just block the merchant from my card to make any unwanted transactions."
better communication
"Great app, steady balanced plan, great video guidence, I stream tv my TV ans work out. This is one you can stick with qns see improvement."
The subscription game continues. I go in to account/ subscription/ and go through 3 pages all deceiving. Get too the end and finalize the cancellation. 3 months later and I get billed again and of course there is no support number to call. If you are the author please I would love to speak with an African prince in distress. please Contact me
Dude i bought trial for .99 cents and they charged full amount and now they don't even let me to login and cancel my membership that's cancer.
Waste of time.
Fake
Purchased 3 month package but after one week it reduced to one month tried to contact with them but there is no direct contact with customer service just computer based auto robot provid specific answer's
"Overall, very good. There's some small things like occasionally losing audio and having cooldown before the option to extend the workout, but ultimately this app has really helped me with my exercise goals."
Just wants money 💰
Avoid. Another subscription scam.
This app is not really good for senior citizens
"Great routines, but audio/visual doesn't match up. You can be halfway through N exercise before the audio synchs and sometimes it doesn't beep when changing exercise. Other than that it's got some fantastic routines especially for home workouts."
"They did not honor the money back guarantee. I injured my back a day after subscribing in a karting accident and asked to cancel the subscription, I hadn't even finished the on boarding process within the app and was told that I cannot get my money back. On top of that you have to pay extra for any meal prep plans. Loads of hidden costs and dodgy policies.... Avoid at all costs..."
"Very Bad useability and no Goodwill. To find the process to cancel the subscription i have to Google, then the process to cancel it is Not working and my bank was debited again, no Option to get a refund or anything like that, never again!"
"Había puesto un reporte porqué quería cancelar la suscripción, me respondieron a través de un correo que únicamente yo podía realizar la cancelación y luego me cobraron. La verdad, el proceso para desvincularse es demasiado tedioso y a pesar de que puse un reporte no lo facilitaron 06/01/23: ya me había comunicado al mail en cuestión sin embargo solo dijeron que debía hacer el proceso a través de la app, a pesar que había comunicado que la app no respondía."
enjoying. helping me train while having less anxiety on new workouts with simple guide on what tondo next
Your app is good but it's too expensive you have to provide some free trial for feel for your product
I could give it a zero if there are zeros in rating ... why would I pay for an app that locks every thing to me and has nothing at all to demontrate as a demo before paying ? This is a total scam
"False advertising,it says one month purchase only but then they charge me 30£ for the next month"
Hard but worth it.
Worst app ever you can access your account to cancel or get a refund they don't even have a phone number to contact which don't make sense you can take people money but when it comes to cancel or getting a refund you have to go through email even there listed number is fake
Refund and cancelation are not easy to receive. Didn't even mean to subscribe and immediately tried cancelling in which you have to send an email to their generic email address. Took money out of my account before i even realized what I did.
Avoid at all costs (cuz it will cost) tried to cancel after the trial and was charged 2 additional big payments - and I don't even know if the payments will stop. 🛑🛑🛑
Not impressed. I used this once and wasnt able to pause my workouts or change the meal plan without a lot of fuss. For £9.99 I expect a LOT more. I'll be seeking a refund.

I love the app but again I justbdidnthe work out and it's not getting checked out what's happening I'm paying for something that's not kepping track of my work.i love the app but I'll be using it for another week hopefully it gets fix cause no more for me.
"Downloaded to check it out -- plans and content are good, business practices are shady and confusing. Canceling a subscription is hidden in help menus, and language is included in help menus specifically calling out that refunds are unavailable to those who have not taken physical or digital proof of workout plans for a minimum of 14 days outside of the app. I needed something to kickstart getting me into the habit of working out, not turn a healthy habit into a stressful burden."
"This app is a scam to get your money. Call it a stupid moment but had no clue it was a subscription. Was charged 50 after 3 months ""trial"" and now refusing to refund. They are not even situated in US. Your money would be better spent with a real trainer."
Gym se jyada paise to ye sirf app bana k le le rhe inke chakkar na padiye Gym jaaiye aaj ke bad Mai bhi yahi krunha
Dishonest. Charged without approval. DO NOT USE!0
When the subscription ends they took money without your knowledge and never respond. Very weak support system. They don't respond when there is a case of refund. App is only useful for beginners only.
"Just get it my dude, 110% worth it as long as you have the willpower to keep with the work plan you'll reach your goal"
I has been purchased this app but Need download the video class when starting workout and take too long time to wait it. More than 15 minutes.
Thank you for your prompt response to the changes that I requested. It's very much appreciated. I will recommend this app to family and friends. Thank you again for responding so quickly.
over all this is a good app. my only issue with it is if I take a break or skip a day it doesn't adjust. Example I didn't open it for a week and when I started back it says I'm on a rest day.
Thieves.
To expensive
Bad ... waste of money
The videos for the workout are so large that it takes 30mins to download. So you can't download them at gym. They are also just wrong. The video and the excercise don't line up. Stupid app
Extra charge! :( They charged me 4 time more than show...it's a scam! :(
It shows you exercises but not useful for being at the gym. Maybe a home gym and you can place your phone up. Also a big deal breaker was that the meal plans are not working. It was actually the reason I paid a subscription. Not worth it.
Not free 😞
This app is a scam! Don't get it unless you plan on paying 30 dollars a month for the rest of your life. They won't let you cancel your subscription. They claim you can do it right from the app but that's not the case. And I'm clearly not just a retard because it happened to everyone else too.
"Let start with the workout. There all over the place, no clear structure to the workouts or what exactly the goal was. Then I decided after the month I was done. Canceled my subscription, which then they gave me a month free. After the month, I was charged for a month. Then the legal team is pushing it off I didn't cancel, but I put my account on froze. Lies, when you go to cancel, you can't put your account on froze. Now there refusing to refund. Look else where, very displeasing app."
They refused to refund my money.
I have deleted the account 2 times and I am still being charged. Buyer beware
Full time West apps all friends please request no download
Nice app but wish I could back out of the app or turn my screen off and it still worked in the background.
They kill motivation don't download it😞😞😡
"They will charge you no matter what. Even if you cancel your subscription, they won't refund."
Very bad
Tried to cancel membership on many occasions and they keep charging me money. Trying to get a refund is impossible been waiting 3 months now and still nothing. The exercises don't even work on your chosen muscle group for the work out . E.g. arm day consisted of many leg work outs . Furthermore the sessions are impossible to do half the time unless you have a private gym with all equipment because of the supersets. It has you hogging all equipment in the gym Don't use this app
This is not free app u have to pay . 😔😔😔😔
"terrible app. you can apply for the money back guarantee refund only 14 days later and only by taking screenshots etc. of your phone somehow showing that youve used the app for 14 days. that, only under those circumstances they might *consider* refunding you. also, when you set up a subscription, there's no way to cancel it. says it takes 24 hours for the ""cancel subscription"" button to appear, but it never does. IVE HAD TO CANCEL MY CREDIT CARD TO GET RID OF THEM."
"Just started using madmuscle today and had a great workout. The app is easy to use and has previews for exercises. I suggest adding more options to the types of equipment you have. It gives you option for none, basic, or gym. I don't quite have gym equipment but I have more than basic. I have barbell and bench but no options for that."
This app is not available for free... It gets all your information and then asks for money to get the workout plan
"I honestly needed some direction since I was just following the same resistance band video from HAASFit, which is amazing, but I decided to try this app out whilst I was looking for a free one. I took the little fitness test, and I was so sure I was more fit than I thought. When the app suggested a lower difficulty routine, I was a little bummed out, but having now done 2 days, I am actually working up a sweat and still feeling pushed at my limits. The food recipe plan is pretty great too."
Don't buy their plan they are scamming
"Dodgy subscriptions. Workouts are actually ok. But they sell their subscription outside of the Google Play payments which is a concerning. When cancelling subscriptions on Google Play, Usually you get to keep access until the remainder subscription period expires. Not so Mad Muscles. They kick you out straight away even if you have paid for over 20 days."
"Less about your health than their wealth. The app itself is mediocre, were the necessity of watching the screen for instructions makes it hard to follow. The instruction not in sync with video. No ability to personalise routine, and they continuously push upsells (like diet plan). Cancelling is also complex. Despite deleting this app >6 months ago, they just charged me £49, - claiming it is clearly communicated in their terms and conditions ..."
Very dishonest. I cancelled my plan but you are still charging my account. Thats dishonesty at its worst. Very disappointed
Pretty basic stuff. Probably get for a beginner but it's not very sophisticated.
"So far - very disappointing. I paid for a subscription and downloaded the app a while ago. I still haven't received a code to login to the app. I sent a note to the support team, and haven't yet heard from them. Very, very disappointing first experience!"
Very fabulous app but prizes are sky touching
Zero zero zero
Please let us know before installation it is paid
Great busway too many notifications that I can't figure out how to turn off
"First time using this service, not bad, if your a healthy individual who wants to gain muscle or just increase fitness and muscle tone then it's great. I can definitely see how it would be annoying though if you had ailments and were trying to work around them."
Stupid
"Be careful, tried canceling the subscription more than once but still getting charges for it monthly, now trying to get it refunded but so far doesn't look like that's happening. Gonna have to cancel my card because they aren't turning my subscription off."
"It takes through a whoooole setup and question then u must pay to unlock anything at all, it's useless if u r not willing to pay."
"Awful experience on this app, mistakenly purchased 3 months instead of 1 and didnt find the app suited my exercise routine, said i was happy to pay for 1 month but the app was not for me, after 20 minutes i emailed support team to say i have mad a mistake can you help, could i request a partial refund, the answer was tough, we have your money no refunds or partial refunds are due, absolutely disgusting behaviour and a bit shady, BE VERY WARY, 100% do not recommend. ZERO STARS"
The videos are poorly thoughtout. 20 seconds per exercise with no prewarning of what is next means you waste a big chunk of the 'time' setting up before it tells you to rest again. Meaning you have to keep pausing. Save your money
Worst app and site ever how you have a site you can't even access your account to cancel a subscription you have to email them even the actual web site you can't call them cause the number listed on my credit card charge is not even in service never use and app that you can't access your account information or change on your own
I'm really glad to subscribe Great app
"IT'S PAID APP. "" DO NOT INSTALL """
great workouts to test your body
"They deleted my account just after that i subscribed to the program, really shameful, and disappointing."
Good amount of various training
"Terrible service. After attempting to cancel 4 months ago, the service remained active and charged me $30 over each of the next 3 months. It seems that after confirming the unsubscription, you have to confirm a second time. After requesting a refund for the three months the app was uninstalled and service was not used, I was denied. Stay away from this app and other apps by the company Uniwell. Where's my money, Uniwell?"
Good overall except I keep trying to find the unsubscribe button can't find it
Not intuitive
"be careful about auti deduction since the cancel deduction in hidden under Help menu! Moreover, next payment will be more than what they show, and also be ready not to receive payment confirmation after they deduct money! To me looks like a scamming app!"
Easy to navigate through and follow the training instructions.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
"The app is easy to use, looks great and is fairly intiuitive... but it hides the fact that the workouts don't change & are not personalised. It won't let you select or change workouts and the most it gives you is 3 days a week. It also trys to charge you an extra £9.99 a month just to access the meal plans. This is a cash grab wrapped up in pretty packaging... don't be fooled."
"Downloaded this app, created an account but never completed the sign up. Somehow I was charged through my PayPal account a total of $80 plus. Only recently noticed it. I'm at a lost for words. Paid $80 for downloading an app that I never used."
It is not free. Don't wast time
going well
Was only able to use the app about 3 weeks due to injury not involving the exercises. I was charged for the subscription renewal in which I promptly requested my account be canceled and refunded. This was within 24 hours of my account being charged. I was told that my request does not fall within their guidelines and will not be refunded for an app that I cannot use for the foreseeable future.
"Update: i emailed support page and they continued to defend their scam artist practices. Just in case you think their support page will change anything, they won't. Scam artists. When they sneak in upsell charges with no confirmation page, they are not a company, they are scammers. When they refuse to credit upsell after receiving communication to do so less than 5 min after transaction, they are not a company, they are scammers. This company is the epitome of horrific business practices."
"Predatory Customer Service, Don't Expect a Refund. I paid for a 3 month subscription to their program (around 70 dollars) and got started. I wasn't thrilled, so I found something else that worked better for me. Three months later, I'm charged another 70 bucks. That's on me for forgetting to unsubscribe, but I figured I'd work with cust. service to get a refund. Lol, nope. Edit: ""Our policy is trash, so we must treat everyone like trash to keep it fair."" That's your response."
"Fraud. I got into the application, and take out a sub. Suddenly the bank phones me and it turns out they've gone ahead and double charged me despite nothing in their terms referring to this. Literally the definition of fraud."
Scam don't use
"Appallingly criminal, asked for a refund and they are refusing this. Avoid 100% they are just after the money the plans are rubbish and the workouts even worse. 0 stars from me. I have an active conversation started with one of the support team, Katherine. And she has told me the decisions is final and that I won't be receiving a refund for this. That's not right."
"This has been the worst fitness app I've ever paid for. No progress is tracked, after you finish an exercise day it's not marked as done. If you skip any day, exercises are not postponed. When adjusting your fitness level, you start again at the beginning with all trainings, basically redoing the exact same exercises you did just before. Any program has only one set of exercises. It's all really annoying. This app is most definitely not worth it, as there are way better apps out there."
The only problem is that it is paid
Worst app forever
Pretty janky app better fitness apps out there for cheaper
"Don't waste your time even considering this app. Run now!!. The exercises are worse than useless. They don't mention that the membership is recurring and it's harder to navigate to cancel your membership than the Labyrinth of Knossos on Crete, and don't even think of requesting a refund as their requirements in their policy is completely impossible to meet. You have to complete 14 workouts consecutively (AND PROVE IT) but if you switch between gym and home workouts it resets your calendar."
"I've installed the application yesterday night and started to work today. Unable to start the excercise, the application getting closed continuously. Need to cancel my subscription and get back my cash."
this keeps me on fire thanks.
the exercise routine is straight forward but the meal plan portion could use some work.
When I realized that the app was a joke I tried cancelling my membership. It's been 2 months and I still can't cancel it. They've charged me over $100 and I even contacted customer service who told me I can only cancel it. I still have not figured out how to cancel it. I tried the website and the app but of course my options to cancel are not there. DO NOT PURCHASE THE SUBSCRIPTION!!!!
"Don't waste your money. Takes ages to download a workout, you cannot edit the workout time etc."
"very good very nice worth the money if you donot know what to do and for how many reps but if you know just go gym and pay , i donot know so i am here 😊"
Only premium and ask too many questions
First 100 questions and last step is payment
The app is quite lacking and it is difficult to cancel a subscription. They will charge your credit card without any advanced warning. I recommend the fitbod app instead.
"Don't bother, I had a medical reason a day into the sub so had to cancel my sub explained via email, I requested a refund as literally a day in and not had chance to use properly, I would of signed back up when I was back right but with the thanks for money you don't qualify for a refund, I'll look for another source instead Gymstreak seems to have a better rating and much better reviews so will have a look further into that for when I'm back right Thanks for FA MM"
I love it so far
awesome
"I like a lot of this app - the exercises are great, easy to understand etc, and a good mix. But, the audio doesn't always match what is on screen, so it will say rest or preview but it won't be that, or the times will vary on screen to the audio. Also, you can't pause an exercise of you need to!"
Charges you after the initial charge. I'm not down for apps that do this with our notification or good reason. Dont waste your money. The food plans cost extra.
I paused the subscription but it still charged me.
Working a dream on week 1 thanks guys
"Don't know what happened, likely my fault but somehow I ended up with PayPal payments going out after I cancelled the subscription here on the play store. Think I may have signed up twice, once on the website and once on the app. In my opinion that shouldn't be possible couldn't work out how to cancel and had to cancel using PayPal. Paid for an extra month I didn't want:( Apps & services that require contacting customer services to cancel don't deserve a try. Just an opinion"
"SCAM! SCAM!! SCAM!!Horrible app literally a algorithm that picks no better exercises and meals than your average gym person. DON'T GET THIS APP OR TRY IT THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY!!...after the email about ""Contact us for help"" they tell you no refund it's final smh. PLEASE DON'T USE THESE PPL OR THEIR APP!!!!"
The app have a very bad user experience. I you want. Especially when dealing with your subscription if you know what I mean. They are more of hustlers than a legit business.
Please tell before hand if its paid or free.
This app is awesome. The workouts are well designed. The meal plan is awesome. Would definitely recommend.
"First day and so far not impressed. Said to use 2 6L water jugs. Why would I have 6L water jugs around. I will check back next time, but hoping these odd item requests stop."
"Ita not free, time wasted by asking questions."
Too much costly and fraud application pls don't install it.
"Exercises get intreruppted by the following workout, the timers are only 20 seconds and then its straight to the next exercise without even a breath in between. The diets are all based on veal or other expensive products that no one really has. Not worth it stick to youtube its free and not a waste of time"
"They are a scam! I cancelled my subscription but they charged it again. When I cancelled it I received a notification that I cancelled it and they ""gifted"" me one free month. Subscription information is well hidden and it's really difficult to find it and cancel it. Their subscription terms are scam and the whole app is heaven for scammers."
Pros: great video demos of all exercises; easy to do at home. Cons: during supersets there is no time given for transitions - even when moving from standing to the floor or vice versa. This makes it nearly impossible to keep up and there is no pause option. The audio volume is different for different things making it hard to listen to music and still hear all cues from the app. Interface is not intuitive. I am bummed I payed for this. It's not fully cooked.
It's not free
This app was too costly atleast 7days get free
To my previous review you have replied app is not free because we hire team and we pay them blah blah..my question was how can someone pay without knowing anything about an app?..not why should we pay. .. You guys want money upfront because you know you have nothing to offer. Just scamming customers out of money by charging without notice and reporting one star reviews ....
"This app stole my money to pay for an additional month's subscription after I canceled. I sent a message to their support about getting my money back, and so far there has not been any response. Personally, I do not recommend trusting this app with your payment information, especially not debit card information as there's no way to get your money back unless they issue a refund."
Too many notifications.
Got the 1st 3 months at there lower rate but never used the app . Didn't know had to cancel subscription thought just trying it out for the 3 months. But had £51 taken out off account because Didn't cancel 24 hrs before start Emailed them to say Didn't know would take the money and haven't used app . Typical not bothered just after the money. Same response to every review also off them . I have been in touch 3 times be they are not bothered just after the money .
there should be indications for when a set is about to end and when a rest starts. it's hard to track if you've missed days
I canceled this app. I was still charged weeks later. Typical scam.
"Hidden subscription for a useless app - money is gone. support does not care. You got me, congrats. Edit: I have reached out to support and they said they can't assist me."
"Seems like half content is older and the other half is newer and better, would prefer to only watch newer workouts. Cannot increase your level without losing your number of workouts and streak record. Would be nice to dial up the difficulty level, somedays are too easy but you don't know until the end... older workouts do not include a 4 minute cooldown like the newer ones. App asks you if you want an additional challenge, but only after you've done the cooldown."
Horrible to cancel
it charged me 2 times for some reason i asked for refund the first day that i subscrbied and didnt get it. i manage to deactivate my account so it stops charging money for other months.
None of the videos working.
"Unimpressed. App is a joke, the subscription was gave no warning it was renewing, forgot to cancel and they ""Can't/won't"" refund. Save your money"
"I enjoy what the app has to offer, my biggest gripe as someone new to working out is that when you are introduced to a new type of exercise you get a silent demonstration and a short, live explanation for the 20 sec round while you awkwardly fumble the motions until you feel like you get it right the third go around. I assume things will become longer the more I use the app so not a deal breaker for me, simply requires me to check out the videos before starting the session."
"I have just started it, it seen nice and very interesting and according to me it is a good app to lose weight and keeps you focus. But the only issue i'm having is that i'm not getting my meal plan and shopping list. And i think if i had that it will help me more to focus on my goal."
subsciption fraud
Absolutely horrible app.. the app kept crashing and wouldn't track anything I was doing! I tried to get a hold of customer service and the only solution they could give me is to restart my phone. Customer service was worst then the app they take DAYS to get back to you and have no idea what they're doing!. I guess the app crashing and not tracking what im doing causing me to not gain any progress doesn't meet their criteria for the 100% money back guarantee!! Most likely a this is just a scam!
Do not use this service. I did not realise my free trial was up and contacted as soon as I was charged. I can't afford this but this company doesn't care. Delete the app
Awesome training plan.
Thieves! Steer clear - they robbed me after I selected a one month plan. I have to get my money back. Outrageous! Don't come and lie that you have nothing to do with any scam tactics. Why? Am I the only one? Lots of people get scammed by you and other scammers you work with.
"I always have trouble in finding what to eat. The app solved me the dilemma by giving me a meal plan, with exchangeable recipes and autogeneratwd shopping lists tunable to the amount of day you want to buy."
I didn't know it was a subscription (prolly my bad). But so unreasonably expensive. Never subscribe. NEVER!
"App interface is buggy, and needs work. Exercises get repetitive after the first 4 weeks. Meals are good, but the recipes are hard to follow if you arent good in the kitchen. Overall its a bit overpriced for what you get."
"Scam app, the refund policy they say is all lies....I paid, 2 hours after I asked for cancellation and a refund as i was charged more than they were saying . It never happened.... 🤮"
"I cancelled my subscription as I only wanted a month to see what the app had to offer, however, the app has charged me once again after I cancelled. Please find a way to sort this feature out as you will not receive good feedback if this is the case and I want my money back. I will say that the exercises are good and the variety is also good but doesn't excuse the surprise billing I received"
"Money grabbing app , stay away. They don't give you a refund even on request."
"App doesn't open most of the time. When it does work, it's decent. But I will unscribe once I can find their well hidden unscribe button."
"I wish the recepies would have a search, but otherwise a very well made application with pretty much everything you need."
Ripped off as well. App wasn't very good and they put price up to £50 and sneakily took it. Not clearly stating it need cancellation SCAM
"The app works excellent. But there are some things which makes me consider changing the app. Chris, the assistant, is a bot and if I have a question to ask, I cannot cos it has the same and automatic responses. The app guides you through exercises but doesn't provide suggestions about when to increase or decrease weights and repetitions. Although stating that I have full gym equipment, you only make use of a certain few. Workouts only change a bit after you repeat the same exercises each week"
some (basic) features seem to be missing (e.g. no recording of weights). not able to change the number of exercises per week. not able to ask open questions to coach. otherwise very helpful and clear videos.
would like to ask questions about weight during lift
I canceled my subscription and they charged me for next 3 months
"This app just ask all the BMI activites of a person and ask to take a subscription and no promises kept as said And I opted for a coach to give some suggestions but always that will be done by BOT (AI Machine )giving the repeated answers all will be picked up from Google that I can google it and get the same answer by surfing ,no personalised diet and no coach Waste of money ,I need my money back no satisfaction,Kindly cancel the subscription and refund me ASAP"
"Didn't like the product. I forgot to cancel. Once I was charged they I contacted them, saying I don't like the product and requested a refund as I hadn't used it in months. But they say I don't fall in the requirements to her a refund. I really don't recommend this product."
Worst app and scam. So they showed up and made me buy. I got unhappy on day 1 and cancelled and told for refund. They denied it. It's a scam app. Buyers beware.
It is a good app for workout.
Predatory app that takes money with hidden charges. Do not use unless you like to lose money and not weight.
Very disappointed in this app. They ask you about all your preferred foods but give you nothing in return. You have to add another $10/month for food. Doesn't even provide a place to log your own menu. Many other apps for less that really want to help you from a beginner to advanced.
"I don't like the way they do the workouts in this app. It gives you very little time for each excersize and to get prepared for the next excersize. And it also doesn't tell you how many reps you should attempt to do and there is no place for you to put in how many reps that you did. I know that everyone progresses differently, but I feel like if they gave us a goal and allowed us to track our reps to see how we progress in future workouts would be great."
Needs money for exercise
They took 14 dollars + 26 Dollars from my account and i didn't get the app i just want my money back 😠
"They charge you while the subscription is canceled. I agreed to and payed only for 6 months, and canceled the subcription at the time I signed up back in november 2022, I found this morning in May an unathorized charge on my paypal for 69.99 MAD. I already reported them to PayPal and Google! If they are going to and continue to participate in this kind of practice, then more extreem measures will be taken! MAD you are not authorized to continue charging me, I gave you 6 months, and no more!"
I paid for 3 months and when I go into app it wants me to pay again. Scam
The best 👊🏾
"The workouts are limited, the functionality to modify the workouts is absent, you have to stick to the proposed routine. In general violate EU refund policy. In particular when you accept the license you have to give up your right of refund within 14 days, guaranteed by EU law."
"Wasted my time, took all the details and then asked for payment instead of showing the results"
"What is wrong with this app !! I even paid for the subscription and now it takes 10mins to open the app , 10 mins to download the video and by that time it already makes me wanna uninstall the app."
Don't download this app. I tried it and found out it wasn't what I wanted so I went to cancel my subscription and they make it almost impossible to cancel you can't contact anyone and they have no spot to cancel on Google since you have to use the web browser not the app
"They ""evergreen"" the subscription. And provide no way to cancel subscription."
Good app
"Completely ripped me off by setting an automatic PayPal payment which I did not request, THEN, charged me $15.19usd for first payment, (which I expected), but then hit me with a $30.99usd payment the next month! I haven't even USED the app yet and I only bought it to test it. Screw you for ripping people off like this. Will never touch any of your apps again, my friends are uninstalling your app and cancelling their payments too. Give me back the $$ !! You just cost yourself 4 paying clients."
I paid for the one month subscription but no use. It asks to pay for it again. Bigger scam . Don't entertain such apps @google inc.
Worst ever app adte taking surveys it asks for payment
"Terrible!!!! Run away from this sh.tty app, i have unsubscribed at least four times and they still keep on charging me... scammers and fraudsters... boring and repetitive app that gives no results...AVOID!!!!"
Horrible. There whole app runs as poorly as the customer service. I tried a 7 day plan and when i went to cancelle it there was no clear way to cancel it and showed that i didnt have any plan or subscription then they went and charged me before the 7 days were up. And refused to refund me even after i explained the situtation and deleted my account on the 7th day. Will never use again and hope nobody else gets scammed.
DON'T BUY INTO THIS. There is no obvious way to cancel your membership. They charge you extra months without you knowing and there is no way to get your money back. Go check trustpilot for madmucles and see all the people that have been scammed there. I recommend you to stay far away from this app or from ever adding payment details. JUST CHECK TRUSTPILOT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. 100S OF OTHERS THERE.
Bad experience 👎
This app is paid from inside. And you get to know it after you provide all your info. Waste of time
Rip off. Rubbish.
Sometimes doesn't register a workout as complete (check marked). Weight progress also cant be viewed properly. The chart is bugged. Other than that. I've been using this for 3 months. Pretty much does the job you want it for.
pretty damn good
I don't have money it's really expensive
Garbage. Pushes notifications on you every hour. The program isn't actually customized. In the quiz you'll say you can do 3 pull ups. The first workout will have you do 3 sets of 15. Terrible app with false advertising. Don't fall for it like I did.
Better apps out there and more customer centric.
1 month 23$
Not worth it and it charges you an extra 14$ still haven't hear back form anyone
"Over priced trash and the Ukrainian flag is nothing but a cheap and sleazy stunt to get more downloads, like putting lipstick on a pig, but a trash product is a trash product! Uninstalled!"
Extremely poor customer service and the app interface is not great either . There is no clear indication on wat plan I am subscribed to
Meal plan is a scam!!! Don't do it. Actually you can find the same thing all over the internet for free...buyer beware! I think the app is from 2010...absolutely terrible!
Great programme
Very good
This is a legal scam. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. They prey on their customers and goad you with the possibility of being fit. It's a flashy app but underneath the business model is shady. Do not waste your money.
"App hopes you forget about it so they can charge you 30 dollars when it renews. They don't send any type of reminder that it's about to renew. Workout plans suck for someone trying to build muscle, not nearly intense enough. Meal plans are unrealistic and expensive. Designed for someone who wants to spend hours cooking."
Can't cancel
Disgusted. I didn't realise this had a rolling payment. Thought I try it for week but didn't use it. Then got charged. And won't refund. Make sure if u sign up you keep an eye on this. So upset
simple and motivational
"I should have read the numerous warnings about this app. Tons of notifications, no flexibility in program, etc. Run!"
This app is not a scam. Yes you pay small fee for personalized plan and meal plan up front followed by monthly after 30days but it's worth it. I'm a private person so the total body workout at home is perfect. Great motivational coaching throughout the process. Reminds me to track My water intake. Pushes me to challenge my limits and I'm confident to see the progress I'll make by staying consistent. This is the app for a workout regimine and meal plan to fit your body type and achieve your goals
Didn't say anything about refund policy before I processed the payment. Also charged all in one go instead of monthly and now they are delaying refund.
Asked 500 questions and in the end asked me for a subscription
"This app is a scam,just try to cancel and you actually can't do it,even after sending numerous emails saying that I need it to cancel I kept been charged every month."
"Scam they keep charging you even if you cancel. If you try to cancel they will tell you that only you can manage your subscription. The instructions they say to go to Settings -> Help -> Subscription -> Cancel or Manage Subscription. But there is not cancel button in that section or any other way to cancel, just a link to page that says the same thing. FULL BLOWN SCAM"
"One of their reasons deemed unexceptable for a refund is ""customer was not satisfied with the app / program"" So if the app sucks and it didn't turn out to be what you expected or failed to satisfy, too bad, that is not a reason acceptable to them for a refund. What a joke. App is trash."
Har cheez mein paisa
SCAM!!! They charge money without your permission and renew the subscription too without even ask you for that!!
Warning. This app will not notify you of impending charges and there seems to be no way to turn them off once you subscribe. I am being charged $30 either per month or per year and I cannot find out how to cease the charges.
Great workouts
I like the workouts simple and challenging
"Appreciated the marketing and the first month price was compelling to get me exercising again. Month two price more than double so this no longer represents good value for me. Also, cannot stand apps like these hiking the price without the courtesy of letting you know before the billing date."
great app! great workouts and love the meal plans!!

"They advertise money back guarantee, but in the terms fine print they write: “Money-back guarantee” does not apply to the following cases: Personal reasons (you don’t like the product, it did not meet your expectations etc.); YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE OUR SERVERS VALIDATE YOUR PURCHASE AND THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE IS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED TO YOU."
Not good service
Paid for the 3 month subscription and downloaded the app. Decided it wasnt for me almost immediately. I was allowed to cancel my subscription but they refused to refund me.
Cheating cheating cheating
No free...paid app
How to get the refund?
"This app is really great! Just what I needed when I was searching for a good app to ""revive"" my body after so many years. The visuals are clear and effective. And the plan(s) are really inspiring. Of course it's a ""general"" thing so I listen also to myself but this app is a great inspiration and workout routine. Just try it."
good fitness program. I was able to change the work outs and schedule to fit in my work and travelling across time zone. some hotel gym don't always have the different gym stuff but I am always. hangs the workout with what is available. the only critic for me is the. cross over to a different exercise there is no break which gets me out of synch. the only way around it is to pause and start when your set.
many app issues. do not respond to customers who spend 15 minutes to detail what could be improved
Workout video unable to download despite uninstalling and installing again. Dissatisfied.
Easy to use. Right amount of reminders and tips. This app is almost exactly what I needed.
"SCAM!!! I WAS ONLY GOING TO BE CHARGED FOR $13.99! I WAS ALSO, CHARGED $15.19, $6.99 AND $15.99. DO NOT GET SCAMMED!!! NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH MY CREDIT CARD TO GET ALL THESE CHARGES OFF AND THEM NOT CHARGING AGAIN!!! I DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH DISHONEST COMPANIES AND ETC..."
The workouts are awesome; sometimes the app doesn't recognize them as complete though. Meal planning add on is a nice feature but would prefer to pick meals in advance for grocery purposes and be able to batch prepare. Swap options are ample.
great plan. I would recommend getting the diet plan as well. Great workouts.
Quite an effective app. Good detail and varied exercises. A bit pricey though
Because of my life I know I don't know how much longer you will get it to me but I'm going back and forth to be honest with you and your family I love you too baby girl 😘
"AI is stupid,incoherent with the actual situation during the programe exercices. 1 min resting time is too much. I do not recomend this appilaction. Is realy lame for the money I spent on it. Sorry, but this is what I think and feel about it! ""Sevenn min work_out"" is way better and if you need more ""fire"" you can repeat the ""se_ven"" as many times you can."
"App is alright. I didn't find anything on it that I didn't know already. Unfortunately, I just had £53.19 taken from my account without any notice, I have requested a full refund for my subscription to be cancelled with immediate effect. I am now waiting for the excuse they will come up with. @Uniwell, I emailed your support team asking for a full refund. Based on the review on here, your app does very little to help, and the ridiculous cost of subscription is the biggest downfall."
Misleading subscription service
Feel the burn. Just a few exercises exposed my weaknesses so I can target those muscles.
I just found out I can edit the schedule which has solved my one main issue.
"A free trial would have been nice. I have workout equipment at home, so I would like to have a ""choose your equipment"" option."
"Scammers!! Was charged during the free trial period, and even charged for a bunch of add ons I didn't order. They refused a refund. If you've been scammed by this app, in the top right corner, press the 3 dots, choose Report as Inappropriate, Select Reason as Other, then type in your story. Eventually, they'll pull the app from Google Play so no one else gets scammed!!"
Has me doing exercises that I would never have done on my own. Love the superset format.
There's lots of bugged things to fix. Rests beep when they're about to end but the exercises don't and the voice talking to you will advertise a test time that is incorrect.
"so far, so good...it's only me 2nd day though"
Keeps charging my account when I didn't purchase a subscription have call and canceled but continue to get charges about to get the law involved
Perfect 👍🏋‍♂️
"It's really good has a lot of tools and exercises and tips at your disposal like asking the assistant for information but I just don't like how most of the timed segments don't audibly say ""Switch"" because I put my phone down and don't look at it. It is paid too but you are getting a lot out of what you pay for."
"Terrible. The app is too heavy, and the videos are too slow. The Support Team are the worst, they simple dont care if you have an issue. I completely regret and dont recommend it."
Great to follow... at home!!!
Worst app in this app to do something you nee to buy 3 month plan .worst app
"It is a SCAM!!! They tried to charge my card and I dont have subscription active. And I can't see any option in app to check/cancel eventual existing subscriptions. Contacted them and they gave me generic response to check for a menu in-app for cancelation that is non-existent. Plus i can see that there are many 1 star reviews, it is not possible to have 5 stars out of 500000 downloads."
"Scam alert. They double charged me and would not issue a refund even though I canceled, they said I was subscribed on the App and on there website. So they charged me $53.19 for another 3 months. Why would I pay for a double subscription on the App and website??!!!!"
"Just avoid, if you do sign up make sure you cancel before the trial period ends as they charge you a fortune. Plans are very generic and you can't change the days. It's all show no substance."
the workouts are not consistent and does not make sense. 2 workout in a row that gives me static exercises 4x in a row without pause in between and call this a super set....that is very odd loll. definitely not subscribing for an other month with them
"I have cancelled this app 3 times, and every few months, it takes €50 from my account . Scam app stay clear I am trying to report it."
"SCAM - BAD software and NO WAY to cancel. The support email address given doesn't work! I'm shocked google allows this on their platform. I saw your response below. However, I'm still being charged for a service I canceled months ago and have written two emails asking for help as to cancel as simply changing the monthly plan in app doesn't work. All this makes me feel like I'm being scammed and your kind words saying you don't scam doesn't stop me from being charged every month."
"I payed user from website. Then install the app. Actually just wanted to test first period and I could not find anywhere unsubscribe, even on app profile even on website. But I eventually check my bank account and saw charged another 53$ that surprised. It's not clear for what? Where is the subscribe information? I want my money back asap!"
great!!
Heaven working this program for about a week now. I'm pretty much on the road non-stop for work. This is perfect. just finished another workout in a hotel room.
DONT use this scam app. Dont let cancel subscription
All is money
Exactly what I needed! I wanted to get into a good habit of exercising and eating better but could never commit when I had to plan workouts and menus myself. I love that this gives me my workout and the meal plan tells me exactly what to make. I've stuck with it for over 3 months which is a record for me. Wish the meals tied in more to the workout goals. Meals are the same for all goals. Also would love to search for meals by ingredients.
I subscribed for one month only but i get charged for 2nd month £30 when i complained they said i should cancel it . The plan is not great im all over the gym to use all equipments.
Don't use this app.They are charge you unwantedly.It's a scam. This is my real experience
"This app worth exactly 1 Cent, misleading information that you will get meal plan with subscription"
"Its a scam.. hard to unsubscribe. I have unsubscribed yet still charged. 30 dollars a month? Thats insane. Got ""robbed"" by this app. Even the T&C is not protect the user. I still expect my money back!"
"Sign up for the subscription. Used it for one day and found it to be useless. Cancel subscription, then it automatically renewed a month later, saying it was still active. Again I cancelled subscription but now it has automatically renewed. I have had to cancel it for a 3rd time. This app has stolen $80+ off me, even though I have cancelled the subscription 3 time but it keeps renewing the subscription."
Daily workout plans are good and easy to navigate. The meal plans however do not show up. There is nothing on the screen. Says no connection when I am on wifi and data. So that's disappointing .
"App code didn't work sick of waiting on reply. Canceled it and asked for refund. Then realized I'd been charged 25.99 app is very misleading on its cost. Would never have signed up for that price. Refused a refund. Avoid. Customer service is slow and unhelpful. As you can see below no help no refund. ""Kindly be informed that all charges can be made with the user's explicit approval.I tried my best to help you and re-escalated your refund request with our Billing Manager"" who refused the refund."
"I canceled my subscription just for them to charge me 30.99 to my account ( Which was double my initial payment ). I attempted to cancel well before my next payment but was told I could only do it one way, which I was unaware of. Not only did I not enjoy the app, they will attempt to scam you if you bring this up to their ""Support"" team. I would strongly advise going to find another app that works better and doesn't end up making get a new card like myself."
Overall a fantastic app if you want to lose some weight and get SWOLE! The customized workplan and meal plan is absolutely amazing. This is my 3rd week of using the app and I'm already seeing great results. This is REAL workout routine!
"Had this app subscription turned off and it charged me anyway, its impossible to find the subscription options not very user friendly."
Unnecessary payments being made
I canceled the subscription months ago. They still charged me. I tried to talk them and they came up with bs reasons to keep my money. Sad that they treat people this way.
"They dont even have a free trial befor paying, what a waste of time , if you are not ready to pay directly with out even seeing the service , then dont download it , you only provide your data for nothing"
"Beware, subscription jumped from £25 to £68 without notice. Refused refund. Update after response: I have been in touch - I left this review after speaking to support!"
The subscription process and it's status in the account is very unclear and annoying. I tried 30 minutes to see the status of my subscription without finding it!
"Aggressive sales process, deceptive calls to action, no refund policy. Feels like a scam. I have contacted support, they said they could not provide a refund due to a no refund policy. That doesn't comply with the consumer rights act in the UK where I purchased."
"Generic workouts that don't event cater to the quiz it asked you. It asked if I could do dips, I ticked no and there it is in my program. Program doesn't seem well thought out either. It gave me upper body workouts 5 workouts in a row and all of them had dumbell curls in it. I don't want to do dumbell curls for 2 weeks straight.. there's no balance. Anyway I asked for a refund and they didn't give it to me either which is also annoying."
"Water tracker doesn't seem to want to reset today? Also I input my initial weight wrong (typo) can i change this? (I'll give 5 stars if I can sort this stuff cos aside from these issues, so far, great app)"
"Cancel your subscription because it's impossible to get a hold of the support team, and get a refund!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Trying to cancel subscription and it's impossible then get my bank to stop you from taking money and had to delete old card to prevent it. Crooks! don't get subscription
No free version or trial period
Not user friendly. Unable to get assistance. No human will contact me. I have emailed multiple times.
"Signed up to free trial, seems I may have forgot to cancel subscription...asked for refund as they would be able to see I haven't used the app so thought the subs were cancelled, refusing to refund."
50$ a month for an app that doesnt help motivate you and doesn't calculate good routines if anything the routines are absurd and has you take too many days off
"Rubbish routine, no thought out into this."
Been trying to cancel for a while and it won't cancel and no one I can speak to about this
"The app is great, it has great trackers, bit this is designed for people who are already very fit. Not for a beginner who is 290lbs and just starting. Inclined bent over lateral raise, the bench at the gym couldn't handle my weight and it fell lol. I was hoping that this app would help a beginner, but it doesn't."
I would like to be able to save recipes. And specify how many people will be with a meal to have it automatically scale. Love what you've done. Let's pump it up
"Not great. The workouts are alright. But there's no way to specify a previous injury or a weakness you want to work on. It's all kind of general. The app is also consistently spamming you with notifications. The ""money-back guarantee"" has requirements that aren't forthright until you try to do the refund. One of which is you are required to use the app 14 days in a row. So basically if you don't track stuck on the days your not doing the workouts then you don't qualify for the refund."
love the simplicity of this and the diversity of work outs and meal plans
Scam with bot customer service replies. Only not replies The app is functional and possibly beneficial for some. The company is impossible to contact and cancel a subscription for. Reply to Developer Sending to your support email results in auto replies only - no people looking at them - I've sent again - specifically asking for ZenDesk case to be opened for conversation with person. I'll update here if that happens or doesn't. No contact from customer service
"Cancelled my subscription and they charged me for a renewal anyway. This is a scam. Don't do it. Also, I want my money back. Not for the time I had the subscription, but the money that was charged after the subscription period ended. THAT'S THEFT."
"Good design but that is almost the only good thing with this app. Lack of exercices, can't create custom pattern for workout, the exercise level doesn't mean anything, the assistant is not an assistant, can't track any data except your weight, and every notifications are about nutrition"
"Very 👎 Just finished the subscription, and i have received 3 emails to join comunity and others spam but i do not receive the code to activate the app despite various attempts and waiting times. 👎 starting I also use other gym app, with great achievements and free of charge. After the message to the support center the code has been unblocked. Unistalled after first use. Better lose money that time. You can not choose the equipmet you have available, select weight, open the promised food plan"
"Almost impossible to cancel the subscription, the instructions run you around in circles. Instructions tell you that under the ""Me"" tab there is a settings function, but it does not exist."
Doesn't state anywhere you have to pay to even see the workouts very misleading with outrageous prices for an app
SCAM DO NOT BUY 30£ A MONTH THEY DO NOT TELL YOU
"Edit: DO NOT BUY. After contacting support to ask for solutions, my subscription was cancelled instead, which indicates fairly incompetent product management and support. For what seems to be an app-centric plan, the app is awful. No way to set particular days as workout days, you have to contact support to update meal plans, etc. Even if you were to follow instructions to manually move every workout - which is awful UX - there are bugs in the scheduling function that make it almost unusable."
"Be careful with subscription. They don't care if you use or not the app, their billing service and manager are just uncaring. Regarding the app, it's so so basic, poor and unuseful. Didn't meet my expectations. Won't recommend it never gonna use it again."
I have written to have my subscription canceled 2 times..because there were 2 $68.16 withdrawals from my account in a week..now this week another $68.16 withdrawals...I want them refunded...it isn't any way to run a business....
still trying to draw a bead on whether I should have had to pay for this...
Will give guidance. But very poor execution. Not an app I'd renew subscription with.
Terrible Terrible Terrible! Should I go on? Asked for a refund as my Paypal account was breached and this is one of the things that was purchased. However they will not give a refund because it doesn't fall into their policy - Which is following the plan for atleast 14 days with PROOF. I never signed up to this and NEVER wanted to even use this stupid programme. EDIT: Still awaiting a reply from an email I sent 2 days go. Shocking customer service
"Cassie in customer service was on the ball for me. I have schizzoeffective disease. I get paranoid. This time especially because I only a few weeks ago I got jipped for a good chunk of money.. She helped me by breaking down why I have a charge for Mad Muscles on my bank account. I thought I'd been hacked yet again! But no. I had forgotten about the app altogether! So this is for the customer service alone. For me....customer service, good customer service can be as important as product."
I definitely don't recommend this app. They charge you without your approval and they will not refund. If I could I would give a zero star.
They stole my money. I paid a one time fee via paypal to try it out and they set up automatic payments without my consent! Do not trust these thieves!
"Hard to use and unrealistic recipes, you need to be unemployedtp be able to follow the plan"
Overall the app is decent. I like being able to substitute exercises in a workout plan.
"Be aware. This group of pople will charge you automatically and monthly once you give them your payment details. They hope and dream that you will forget disable auto subscription to charge you again. Even homeles people ask you for money and waiting for you to decide pay them or not, but these people will not even ask they will take the possibility once you give it"
Don't use this app! I downloaded and purchased a 3 month subscription. I cancelled it weeks before I was to be billed again and was still charged. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
"Good at first, follow into a trap after. They said money back guaranteed, my bad, I bought it to look at the exercises and plans, now that I'm not interested to get my money back I have to send proofs videos of my work out. Terrible experience."
"Waste of money if u reached level 5, u can only change the Superset, not a single exercise like the normal apps do"
"Rubbish I don't know how I got linked into this from another workout app. But after buying in & paying extra 4 meals i selected beef chicken only and I still get options for seafood yuck. There's no where to add ur own workout plans as they are set in and the calendar is a day behind from my country, so I can't even edit my own workouts, nothing. What a waste of money lucky I paid for a week's worth . 2 stars because the app looks polished in terms of template but severally lacks functionality"
Doesn't log extra days I work out. Would be nice to log the weight being used for the exercises to be able to increase in the future
"Very unhappy. Deliberately misleading cancellation process where ""delete account"" does not unsubscribe you. And you can't even unsubscribe in the app, you have to press 20 links and push a tiny button on the website. Lost £30 AFTER deleting my account with the dedicated button which makes no sense to exist if it does not unsubscribe you. Even after contacting they had no intention of helping. Scam"
Thieves they will take more than agreed
"The app refuse to refund . I can change my mind in 14 days...i changed mi mind in 20 min.Do not buy this app. Is total disaster. Errors, spam etc they suck another 25 dolars from my card for meal plan even if they say is included .scamers Ps: i already contacted you and you refused to refund. Not eligible.... never deal with you again scamers"
This is paid app:( All features locked untill subscription with payment:(
Takes extra money out without notification
"Worst app, do not sign up. They have the worst cancellation policy. App is useless. Like others I tried to use it and customise."
"They make it seem like a meal plan comes with the program. It's only after you choose your subscription type and pay that they say it's an extra $10/month for the meal plans. It also doesn't say that the discounted price for signing up will go back to the original price after the first payment period. I got the 1 month plan for $15, and nowhere did I see that it was going to be $30 after that. I could not have understood the deal, but it definitely wasn't obvious that the price went up."
After the 3 month subscription ends it renews automatically without asking for your permission and charges you 70€. Of course when you apply for a refund they will tell you anything so as to not return the money. Avoid at all costs!
"Terrible App and worse company. Tried for a week, wasn't what I was looking for so canceled knowing id pay the first months fees. However I was charged for the next month. Tried customer support but they claimed to have a ""strict cancelation policy"" AKA we're going to take your money even if you canceled through our terrible App. Don't waste your time here."
Why the hell cant i find where the subscription option is.... the app is designed to make it difficult foe users to unsubacribe.... make it clear
I Love it!!!
"Absolutely ridiculous cancellation policy. Be aware as it is a scam! Purchased a workout plan and a 30 day meal plan. Downloaded the app to realise that what was advertised was not what I got. The app interface is very clunky with not a lot of customisation options and the meal plan is very rigid with seemingly random macro and calory calculations. To get a refund you have to ""use"" the app for 14 days and prove that you used it via a screenshot. This is not clearly stated before the purchase!"
Scam! I buy for a week just have a look what's the app for £6 and after charge me £30.99 without quastions not refundable because have some inside rules. In the app I see only basic illustrated things. Google same info giving you for free!!
Fraudulent Charges
"Still has some bugs, even when the workout is finished sometimes it won't check it as done and sometimes will make lose the streak, besides that is pretty good, the workouts are relatively easy and precise for the type of workout you want to do"
"I bought the app with the interest of starting my fitness journey. I was disappointed with the fact that there wasn't an option for selecting your equipment and whatiscle groups you would like to work on. My mistake was buying the lifetime package. If I would of known that I wouldn't of done so. My fault. Yet, if you have time to hit the gym then get it for the reason I believe what it was made for."
Great verbal coach & rest timer is a plus.
"You can't cancel your subscription,"
"Purchased a 1 month workout plan, after 1 month was charged again, double the amount I paid the first time, and did not even get any new workouts for the additional charge. Have contacted the developer."
"DON'T BOTHER. The ad for this app showed checklists - you don't get checklists. Instead, you have to navigate individually through each day and play the exercise videos as you exercise. THE APP DOESN'T RUN ON THE BACKGROUND. You have to keep it running on your screen for the videos to play. Presumably, this is because you have to provide screenshot evidence of having completed the workouts for 2 weeks before you're given a refund."
"I bought a 16$ sub to this app and another 30$ the next month, i immediately canceled my sub after the second payment through their app. To my surprise it was never canceled through the app and i was charged again. Do yourself a favor and cancel this garbage directly through your bank or paypal if you make the mistake of using it."
"Does not keep what it promises. It illudes that a meal plan is included with subscription but of course it's not and you need to buy an expensive subscription to the meal plan. The app is totally worthless, not flexible at all. If you want temporarily switch from a gym workout plan to home workout, for example if you need to travel, it erases all workout history and makes you start from scratch when you try to get back to gym workout. Guys, don't waste your time with this stuff!"
The worst situation I have ever facesd with an app. I canceled subscription and I have been charged. And still I go to cancel subscription icon and can't do unsubscribing.. I also send email to support team they never answer... Please dont subscribe if you want to have a safe life.. 💔
Can't stop the reoccurring charges!
VERY cumbersome subscription management. Cancelation... seems like they want to force you into keeping the subscription by simply giving up.
So i subscribed to the trial and the day before the expiration billing i reached out to cancel. I saw they tried to pending charge me i advised them im a disabled person and this doesnt fit for me. These scammers said i would need to show that i used the app for a time period to cancel and be refunded the new charge make it make sence. DONT USE BUYER BEWARE. IM REACHING OUT TO SUE FOR MY $60 shame on you. It seems we live in a scammee world ppl want something to give nothing. YES U R A SCAM
"I accidently entered my weight in kilograms instead of pounds. Now it says I weight 450 pounds when in reality I weight 160, It won't let me change it."
I'm connected to internet and app says I'm not
too freaking expensive for a broken app like this
"It seemed like a good app. Yet I cancelled my subscription and they charged me again. Now they're refusing to refund me for a subscription I had cancelled, and an app I didn't use after canceling. Save your emails and make sure you cancel or change your payment method to be save they can't get any more money out of you. I did email you guys, of course you guys claim I never cancelled the subscription. Shame on you guys.. 😡😡🤬🤬"
No way to cancel so you have to cancel with your bank to block the transaction. Support just takes you to the app which sends you back to the website
They're not forthcoming about what prices you'll actually be paying. I started with the $7 week trial (which wasnt disclosed as a trial) and they automatically charged $31 after the week was up. As an unemployed college student I don't have a shitton of money to throw away on workout apps and all they can do is say sorry lmao. Also the workouts weren't worth even $7 imo
This is not working for me.. I would like a full refund. How do I get a full refund?
Useless and expensive
"For an app that charges money they got some nerve on features. Obviously your mileage may vary based on device. But things like rest timers pause when you change screens or shut off when screen off which is silly, every app I've used has this even free ones. It gives you no weight suggestion. It's like why even ask me tons questions. Just seems lazy oh just do 15 reps x3. Will not pay for another month better options out there. I was like dislike pull ups what is first thing I'm given Pull up"
"The one time purchas is a sub. It spends the entire time selling you it's other apps, Along with this the quality of the workouts vary a lot, the instructions and their quality vary, it's not worth the money or the now 75 bucks I have paid because it auto renewed me with NO WAY TO UNSUB! EDIT: spoke to support like the comment from mad muscle said, NO REFUNDS! Pretty much was told sucks to suck you didn't realize the 3 months was NOT a subscription and we hid the unsubscribe button good luck!"
Really useless.
Can't cancel
"App does not work. It crushes, and it is too expensive. No support !"
easy to follow
Great app. The exercises are awesome & in a very short time I have seen amazing gains.
"Worked great, but as of last update the workouts I'm doing aren't being counted as completed. Workout itself still works fine which is the more important part, but it's a bit of a nuisance point on metrics tracking."
"The login is broken for my Pixel Pro 6. I wouldn't ever leave a review for something like this except that the company refuses to provide me a refund. Do not do business with this company, their support is terrible."
"I dont remember even signing up for this subscription, but I tried it out once I saw I was paying for it. It is too expensive, not really good and the customer service is horrible. They are just mining money with people who subscribe for a free month, and then they charge you a non refundable fee for a useless application."
"App doesn't signal end of exercise, so I have to constantly end the screen. I have now entered an exercise cycle called ""Demon eyes"" where they don't even include a timer"
"DO NOT USE THIS APP. The company is absolutely terrible in managing their clients, half of the content they say they offer is not there. When I cancelled I was still charged for 3 month subscription even though I cancelled on the same day the money was taken out of my account. Then when requesting a refund, they tell me they can't refund my purchase because there isn't a reason to in their mind. Terrible business, terrible app, TERRIBLE customer service who r only interested in your money."
make it almost impossible to cancel subscription should have a option in the app shouldn't have to email constantly with no response while you take my money....
im enjoy it so far especially because i do work out on my own schedule love ❤️ the cardio super sets 💪
Trying to cancel my subscription is impossible. I emailed support. They told me to go to the app to cancel. The support email had detailed instructions on how to cancel in the app that don't work Edit: I received an email saying that my subscription was canceled prior to yesterday and that's why I couldn't cancel on the app. Except I was charged just under $54 on Sunday for Mad Muscles. Why a charge if my sub was allegedly canceled already?
I do not see any options on cancelation of my subscription
It took a payment out of my bank without authore
This app is very bad. It is not good as it was promoted on their site. I suggest other potential buyers to do not buy it. Don't waste your time and don't wast your money. Also I have requested a refund but they refuse to give my money back!
The app fails to send daily notifications and thus making it somewhat useless.
App wasn't what I expected and when I tried to get a refund my request was denied. There's better apps than this one that offers better workouts and guides. Money wasted!
"Good program. But one issue is that you have to finish the 30-minute run workout video to have a work out say Complete?? Why? I can lt exit the app and have it in the background running. Nope, it has to be on my screen. That is annoying. Fix it and I give 5 stars"
Garbage
App was fine but when you try to cancel the font is so faint on the pop up window you'll think you cancelled but will get billed anyway.
"All good to take money, but when to unsubscribe kept going in circles.... Best way , cancel the card !!"
You can't connect the program to your TV... They ask you to buy an app to do Mirroring..There is no sound notification between exercises!!! You have to keep looking at your phone to see when an exercise starts or when it ends..!!! Tragic program there are much better and cheaper than this!!!
"To many notifications. Normal people work during the day. They can't workout any be time they want. Also I've tried to figure out how to cancel for two months, I can't do it. That's why the stars. Maybe someone will let me know or contact me. Maybe not. But you're going to make r change my card so I don't get charged again? This is ridiculous. I've email twice two month in a row. $30 , $60 and what another month $90. It is worth the money of you can use it. I can't. Please cancel!!"
"A misleading scam! If you purchase the app, you will still have to purchase additional resources within the app. In my experience, I purchased the app ($30 monthly fee), and they STILL wanted me to purchase a meal plan. SCAM!"
Terrible
Terrible
No way to cancel in the app... just making it as hard as possible for people to cancel once signed up
I discontinued this app awhile ago and it charged me 15$ out of nowhere. I wondering if deactivating your account will cancel the subscription.
It's OK but just seems a mishmash of lots of other products out there.
Not awesome. Damn near 50 bucks and the chest day workout is all lat pull downs and squats. You'd be better off with yahoo answers
Can't unsubscribe
They ask you to cancel your subscription 24 hours but do not provide a way to manage your subscription within the app.
After doing 1 month and seeing that I am better off going to the gym then doing the trash workouts they give you I cancelled my plan and they offer me a free 1 month so I thought I'm not going to use it but why not after the end of the free month I got bill 50$ and at first I was not sure why so I emailed them and said can I please get a refund for a accidental purchase but they said because I got the free 1 month it activated my subscription again so I was not allow a refund overall its a SCAM
"Easy to follow training programs tailored for you. You can do workouts with or without equipment and change up the exercises whenever you feel. It has a weight tracker and a spot to take progress photos. Great if you want to lose weight, gain muscle or tone. Would recommend this app to anyone who wants to make a change!"
"Overall, this app keeps me accountable and on track. What is frustrating is that I complete workouts but it doesn't seem to recognize it. I've done about 30 workouts and click on completed at the end and I think it shows I have done 5. Also, I'd like some more variety in my workouts."
CHARGES YOUR CARD REPEATEDLY AND DOES NOT GIVE U A WAY OF CANCELING. THEY GIVE YOU A FAKE WAY BUT THE LINKS ARE NOTVTHER. DO NOT MESS WITH THIS APP. I'M TRYING TO GET MY $$ REFUNDED NOW 😡😡😡😡 #SCAM
Don't get this app. The price I was billed was more than twice the price advertised. The app itself is stick figures and audio. No practicalway to get a refund from them. Just lots of circular links that amount to saying call Google for help. It's just a scam. Stay far away
I canceled two months ago but they still are debiting my account. Im now going to take this up with my bank and its fraud unit.
"Bad experience. Purchased the app for $15 and realized that it was also a subscription based situation. Never used any content in the app and engaged customer service right after purchase for a refund of the $15. Explained that I did not want a subscription service and I used NO content in their app/program. Refund denied. Tried explaining this again in further detail. Refund denied. Very upset that this company GREEDILY kept my full $15, didn't budge at all. Recom. to avoid this company"
direction vocals stop playing randomly along with rest breaks between sets and not checking off my completed workouts.
Weak app. Beginner ex. And cannot contact them
"Hey, i have eaten and done all the exercises like the app told me, i lost 21KG in 2 months. I never leave Reviews but this deserves it, Thank you a lot."
It costs money
"I purchased a plan from this company that lauted building muscle with no equipment needed. Upon beginning my first workout, I was informed that I would need 6 liter bottles of water, something I do not own and would also qualify as equipment. I immediately requested a refund but was denied on the grounds of their money back guarantee does not apply to dissatisfaction. I was only dissatisfied on the grounds that the program was said to need no equipment, yet required equipment. Do not purchase."
Tried it for a month. Didn't like it. Not much variety.
Have to Get Use To How App Works. Don't know where to log weight used for a specific exercise.
It just sucks...
They do not honor their 30 day money back guarantee. They will say your claim doesn't meet their standards and deny your refund. Horrible company with a pay to play product. Deleted quickly due to none stop notification.
this app is amazing. so versatile and so much to offer
The fact that this is a subscription base service is unclear and hidden at the bottom in the fine print. Please beware that although it states big on the front page that its only a 1 Mont plan it auto renews and you need to cancel your subscription if you only want the 1 Month plan. I feel that they can make it a bit more clear that this is monthly. I also see that there are more people that experienced this issue in the reviews.
"Worthless! Wish I had never wasted the money! 3-26-2023 Giving it another try,I hope I like it this time."
Works very good
Won't allow me to cancel my subscription. Subscription tab not showing..
They make it impossible to cancel your subscription and will not return emails or help in any way.
"Programs are good, and food is OK. But second month it changed me double price without noticing me."
"The app is a rip off do not sign up to the trial, they charge you 7.99 for a week and then will auto set up £30.99 charge a Month. The app is rubbish and the training videos are sub par. Save your money to use on gym membership."
Been using this app for 3 weeks now. I do like the swapping customisation for workouts. I do feel it lacks in a wide variety of different weight work outs and well as cardio workouts. Would like to see more cable machines etc. Would be nice to have pre-made workout regimens to swap instead of single.
Bad. The videos a badly put together. Audio is often wrong or happens at the wrong point. Video tell you to rest when you are still meant to be excersizing. Too many issues to mention. Just seems to be very poor quality control. Syncing with Google fit also doesn't work
During purchase it is not transparent you buy subscription and they will automatically charge you after your intial plan is finished. When you try to cancel subscription in the app it keeps active and you don't receive any email or other confirmation about cancellation.
You have been warned! A total waste of time and money. Attaboy drink more water...Cha ching$ not worthy of one star. I don't believe the rating for this app this 4.8 when you read the reviews for for the money nobody's happy with it. -1 star
"Subscription scammer, The subscription is built deep in the so it's super difficult for you to find and the charge you regardless of stopping the service. And when you email them for it they apologize and say nothing we can do about it. Horrible customer service, don't waste your time and money. . Update march 16th, 2023 : still no refund, they are trying to bribe me with 3 months free to remove my complain Still no reply !! Definitely a scamming app stay away"
App might be good for others but not for me. I used it for a few minutes and quickly realized it does not fit my needs. I requested a refund which was denied.
Very disappointed by this app. There is no way to cancel the subscription on the app or on their website. I have not been using the app and requested that the subscription be cancelled and they still pulled from my credit card. Its been a week and still no response. I would like to cancel subscription and have the funds that was pulled returned. Thank you. Very disappointed.
This app is a scam I cancelled my subscription according to them and still got charged the next month. Absolutely illegal stay away from this app.
Great workouts but need direction like 1-50 or more steps in order. I didn't see it but I miss it ??? Why too much $25.99 you have problem here?
Scam!!! Dont bother. Will charge your credit card secretly
"I actually like the workouts so far, but the app is really not user friendly, so much so, I am considering using a different program altogether."
"I purchased one month and thought that only one month I purchased. After this period I saw that they automaticly charged me with double the amount and realised that they made me a subscription. Cancelling the subscription is not something that you can do easily, it's not showed on Google Play. Be carefull, if you don't want a subscription this is what you'll gonna get and they will charge you even if you don't use their service."
worse than the free apps can't even change workouts
"Not pleased, because they are fighting me to keeping my refund. After signing up I was unable to login. It would come up with an error saying tells us what happened here and contact us through support by email. I asked for cancellation and told them whats going on, they are stalling and refusing to cooperate to give back my full refund. Because this is a fitness doesn't mean it isn't going to be shady. Be careful out there. We are at a time of money gougers and scammers."
Nightmare useless app what try to make you profi water drinker and if you not happy forgot about your 30 days money back guarantee it's not exist if you want to pay for something what's already for free in your phone then this is ap for you just lots off spam paid useless extras 0 value
"It doesn't tell me when the workout is almost over, so there are times when I'm doing it and then it immediately goes into the next exercise without giving me time to prepare. It counts down when the rest phase is almost over, but it doesn't do the same for the actual exercise which is frustrating. Everything else is good except for that."
"Cool if you want an exact program, as soon as you plug in what you're working on. Back for example, there is no way to find a chest workout."
"You can trust the company. The app was easy to use and helped me starting training, not very customized but made its job. After the first month at the cost of somethig around 15 euro I didn't expect the charge of 30.99 euro. The real cost of the service, wasn't clear for me. I wrote to the customer support and in less than 24h I received a response and a refund of the 30.99. Very GREAT customer service and honesty from this company."
Awesome application this isn't free still fair though. Just be healthy or some what fit with regular visits to the doctor and make sure to let them know your plain of exercise safety first all I need extra is all cheers for experiences
Nonstop error messages. Absolute shitshow of an app.
It doesn't state as subscription yet it took 31 € AFTER ONE MONTH WITHOUT ASKING IF I WANNA CONTINUE euxomai na kaeite zwntanoi oloi sas poutanasgioi
"They collect subscription and app never work. No support, bad start. Discouraging. Update: reached out to support the app is now working, had some restrictions in the USA (my connection) but works really well and exercise is effective. Definitely worth a try. One thing i wish the app have is to cast to tv, it would make the exercise much easier than looking at the phone."
Says it's for everyone but it you say you are younger than 18 it doesnt let you join.
The workouts are okay but are so rub heavy it is ridiculous. The meal plan is way too much. I'd have to have a personal shopper and never have to worry about money to keep up with it. Overall not really worth it.
"""Cancelled"" my subscription, but got no confirmation that it was cancelled. Contacted ""customer support"" asking them to verify that my subscription has been cancelled and they refuse to answer. DO NOT Pay them ANY money!! You'll get screwed! I may have to change my card because of them. Edit: I have contacted them twice. Tell them to answer the email I've sent!"
so far this app has lead up to its claims my energy levels are going up and my weight is coming down
Wa Ted to cancel my subscription they said it was canceled and still charged me the next month.
Have to pay to get workout plans?I prefer doing the exercises i want.0/5 stars
app is good but more money was taken and not refunded even after I asked to return. Will not be continuing service after 3 months. Quite disappointed
"The app functions great, allows for exercise swaps and has videos for everything. The routines it builds though are terrible. Anyone who wants to start off and is using this app to develop a good pattern is going to struggle to work through the exercise routine. It asks a lot of questions of you to customise your workout. It started me on 2 set of 10 crunches and by week 2 wanted 3 sets of 20 among others. Unrealistic and demotivating. You're better off spending the money on a PT n routine"
Out of all the little issues the biggest one I'm still having is I canceled my subscription via the guidelines they had stated in there terms. 2 months later I got charged $53.27 to my card even though I was told it was canceled. Waiting for them to contact me back. Also canceling said subscription is a ridiculous pain. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS SUBSCRIPTION! You will regret it if you don't heed this warning.
"Working out should be something for the mind, but unfortunately this app is making me frustrated by every workout. I really enjoy working out with sound cues, so you don't have to stare the screen all the time, although the cues for the app are set to a wrong step, or sometimes you just don't get the cue when to start another set, or the voice instruction says ""hold until the sound"" and no sound ever comes. These are simple things which should be incorporated in any decent fitness app."
"This app is absolutely terrible and almost seems illegal. Most of the interesting stuff isn't included in the base product and requires you to pay an extra amount a month which they don't make clear at first. Also, the refund system they tell you about where if you haven't used the app for a month you can have your money back is all a lie. This app is over £20 a month just to see some excercises which you could just look up on the internet for free, and there is no refund."
"Do not waste your money. Absolute garbage. It is not customised at all, very generic. Support staffs replies are as generic as the programs."
Take money from your account without permission and impossible to unsuscribe from
"great workouts planning and easy to use for those who step into working out, without a plan or knowing what workouts to do."
"I selected to cancel my subscription weeks in advance, I didn't know I had to refuse their 1 more free month to confirm my cancellation. I was charged 82.45$ Canadian on the renewal date, which I noticed 3 days later. Contacted the support, they are not issuing me any refund. They are charging me 82.45$ for 3 days. Terrible customer service. After contacting support (again as per their response below), they stand by their decision. Despicable corporate greed"
"App is still very buggy, can't change schedule"
"Money grabbing tactics!!!. Filled out the questionare on the website, within it, it asks questions about meal prep and planning. Leading me to believe that this is apart of the app. It's not. It's additional cost. I signed up and downloaded the app. Found out it's not actually included. Cancelled right away. I went back through the questionare to see if it says the meal prep is not included.... It doesn't They won't refund me my money."
"They refused to issue a Refund, only 10 hours after payment, Bad experience 😰 They have the Worst Refund Policy 👎"
Says it's free then you have to pay for a plan after the questionnaire.
"I did purchase a program for life last year with an offer I found online. I was using the app for around 3 months. I had to travel out of the country for a couple of months and when I came back home I started to go to the gym again just to find that the app is not allowing to use it without pay, again. I have been sending emails to customer service they told me that I don't have any life program and they just stopped answering to my emails. Simple, you can screw your self."
Awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️
I've tried canceling the subscription but the directions are completely wrong.
"Same workouts, recipes are unrealistic with cutest and menu items."
Absolute rubbish and a complete waste of time and money. I couldn't believe the workout that was presented as advanced. Beginner will likely be awful!
look 9mm2lom2lommlokl to k2k2mlo
Everything in this app is done through an automated system. Good luck customizing anything for special health needs. It assumes everybody has full mobility and access to expensive workout equipment
"Very good weekly plans, you just need do the work but program are ready."
Waste of money. The workouts are super basic and generic.
"some features are good. There are 2 key items that made me give this grade. 1. The inability to manually schedule workouts beyond the calendar week you are in. You can only move workouts and rest periods around for that week. 2. When you cancel even though you PAID for the month, you cannot access it again. So I paid for it on March 7th. Canceled on March 12th (5 days) thinking I can access UNTIL the membership cancels however not the case.. LOCKED OUT and only way back in is to renew."
Terrible
"You can support Ukraine with your money, not mine. My government already gives more than enough of my tax dollars to this mess. I will never willingly hand over my money or give support. I wish I knew about your virtue signaling before I signed up."
will not let me cancel subscription
I love it ...but I can't get the timer to work when taking photos. Is it a bug or am I doing something wrong? Thanks!
You will be sorry if you use this and you are a serious gym person. Too many issues with this app to even list.
Scam. Still charging me 30.00/ mo. Have followed how to cancell. Will not stop. Filing a complaint with my credit card company.
Was curious so I tried it out. Its pretty much a joke. The app is awful and less functional than pretty much any gym app I have used. Like simple stuff like recording weight lifted and changing splits are non existent. as a.workout tracking app I wouldn't even use it if it was free. and the workouts are very very basic stuff you can find anywhere for free (or make yourself). Literally zero reason to pay for any of this. I canceled about 20 min after I bought it.
How do I cancel/get a refund?
"Not easy to use, not what expected Signed up for the $6 one month, immediately charged me $20!!! Repeat charges in my card. First routine is jumping rope, which I can't do, and there's no way to modify. It asked if I could do burpees and I said no, it wants me to do jump rope and burpees!!! This is not an itemized gym workout or list of exercises to go through."
STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP. SCAMMER ALERT!!!! LOST 30$ DOLLARS TO THESE GUYS
"I signed up to get a program, and you literally can not navigate through it to work out. You're in the gym and apend most of the time looking for chrst a tricept day or whatecer. It doesnt sayvyou are charged every month. i wasted 60 bucks!"
It was terrible. It won't let you cancel your subscription!!!
"BEWARE!!! I downloaded a workout app and while I was in the app I was directed to this app without knowing it. I made the payment for which I thought was the original app. When I explained that I made a mistake they would not refund my money but offered me 3 free months. I already paid for 3 months, and I just wanted my money back but no luck. Not good business practice."
"Neutral decision, everything other thab the initial ""intro"" is another cost. With out the fine print up front, to me it's a lil bit kis leading."
Dont buy this subscription they will charge you out of nowhere i authorized for 15$ they charged me 15$ and extra 10$ beware this is a fraudulent company !!
"Been using the app for roughly a month. Not bad, good excercise and makes use of any equipment you might already own. They could improve the widget to track water intake instead of having to open the app to do it. Meal plan is an extra charge . That really stinks seeing how I'm already in at $30 a month cnd . I say just use the internet to find a meal plan. I did and it didnt cost me any extra. I have lost 10 lbs so far and definitely starting to show small gains already."
Tried canceling a free trial and couple months later just got charged 3 times. The help on the website show screenshots to change subscription in the app there is no option to change subscription. Be careful if you're thinking you just want to do the free trial. UPDATE After contracting the support team they say we would like to fix this and ask for my phone model and os and say that my account is canceled and no more charges will be coming. Then get charged that day for their glitch in software
Very bad app
"Pure fraudulent marketing. I'm hating the fact that I've fell victim to superficial appearance and ended up with nothing but bluntly automated app with no comprehensive approach to an individual. It erases all the progress you've made if you make a slightest adjustment to the program; asks for additional money for diet plan(regardless of ""charity"" you already gave away for the app); swapping the exercises would give you totally unrelated options for designated muscle group. What a shame."
I don't understand why you would go into my account and charge me approximately $54 when I have not accessed your app since January the 1st and that was doing a free trial of which I canceled before the trial period ended....can you return my money and make sure your agent cancel my trial membership as she was directed to do so?
"There is nothing on this app u can't get for free app, there was very little customization to workout preference and the app is just awkward to use. Not really impressed"
"It charged me 15 dollars when I saw the ad on Instagram then I downloaded the app but now I can't access the work outs and now it's saying to buy it again for 30 dollars, even though I was already charged 15 dollars. I'm very dissatisfied with this app"
"Beware! Their website makes it look like you pay for a tailored sports routine of a chosen lenght. Once bought you'll notice in the fine print of the receipt, that it's in fact a subscription course, incl. massive price increase after the initial run. So you only get a single run of your pseudo tailored routine, and tricked into a subscription scheme. Also the promised refund is basically a fake. Shady practice at best."
"Predatory subscription mechanics, don't do this to yourselves."
I have been working regularly for the last 6 months. I just switched to this program. First workout on this training program was more difficult than any other workouts I have done. It's amazing!!!
Iam being told that I should come here to fix a problem I have with the app and its annoying pls fix it
"I tried to open the apps thru my gmail account, suddenly crashing cannot open anymore. I paid yearly but apps not working"
"So far so good has exercises in a nice organization, needs 2 updates though. It doesn't let you pick what equipment you have and what you don't so you have to manually change each exercise if you dont have the equipment. Also it should have something to help you track what weight you used for an exercise last."
"February 2023: Deceptive subscription policy. Bad form. I selected what I thought was a short-term subscription. If an auto-renewal was disclosed, it must have been in very fine print. It certainly wasn't conspicuous. UPDATE March 2023: Although I canceled my subscription and deleted my account in February, Mad Muscles just tried to charge me another $30 yesterday. That's not just deceptive, that's attempted theft. If I could give this app negative stars, I would."
"Joined because in the ad said you can opt-out anytime if you are not satisfied. I contacted their support to cancel and to get the refund, apparently they have a specific criteria where you must try the app for 14 days and make a video of yourself to prove that you tried it, before they accept a refund. This app is no better then Adidas Training app, actually is worse. If you have second thoughts and you don't want to ""donate"" money to the them, don't join! Adidas Training app, it's 100x better"
Can't customize meal plans or workouts it gives you the option to do so in the beginning but it completely disregards everything that you said. If you wanted to put a meal plan together that is a foods that people actually like allow me to choose the foods that I want to eat and then you prepare the meals around those. Also there is no button to cancel the subscription so that I don't have to renew in the managed subscriptions. I paid 3 months that's all I want just make it easy to non-renew.
Complete scam. They charged my card 4 times in less than 12 hours and still never gave me access through the ap. It was as though they charged me for opening the ap after sending me a notification.
The app never would give me workouts in the range of time that I needed them for. They were always too long. I forgot to cancel the free trial and was charged. I immediately requested to cancel and get a refund since I had not been able to use it at all and was told that they would only offer me 3 free months but wouldn't refund anything. What good is 3 free months when I can't even use the app. Terrible customer service and app.
I'm trying to cancel my subscription because it continues to charge me
"I just downloaded the app and completed my first workout. I really don't feel this is what I'm looking for, especially since it was based off of my answers and there is nothing here in the workout that even begins to be in the areas that I indicated. I purchased, paid, and downloaded today. Is there any way to get a refund? Edit: contacted only a few hours after my review and the outcome was favorable. Thanks MM. Sorry that you guys weren't what I was looking for right now. Good experience."
I like the workout and the app is easy to use. The only downfall is that it requires data services which makes it impossible for me to use it while deployed without data services. If there was a way to use it offline I would give it 5 stars.
"Total rip off, debited my account without permission. Hide options of how to unsuscribe. After review replied unprofessionally. Beware of auto renewal of €30 a month."
Scam app. They make really hard to find out about your subscription and how to cancel it. Avoid at all costs
To pay for fitness help then get this is total trash didnt even receive my meal plan shady business no help hotline
"Near impossible to cancel the subscription. Followed the supposed directions on the app as how to cancel. Still got charged. No way to talk to someone from customer service. Had to cancel my debit card and get a new one just so they would stop charging me. TOTAL SCAM. Guaranteed I will get a ""bot"" response stating how sorry they are and how they strive for great customer service. They are full of $$it."
You input info and it expects you to be some super star on day 1 like I told you I was fat 15 pull ups come on I can even do 1. But the reminders of drinking water and stuff is ok but maybe you should think of otherwise to help us fat people lose weight
"SCAMMER- Waste of 10 minutes of my day I can't get back. Pretends to be free by inviting you to fill in health and fitness form and at the end, it won't continue until you choose a payment plan. Thats theft, time is money. At least give me an option of a trial after that long form. ‐‐---------------------------------------------- I didn't wanted a trial in first place. Why ask me all this questions if theres nothing to give back in return . Not fair for the people that decide not to purchase."
"App sucks, horrible navigation system, overall I give it LESS THAN 1 STAR."
When you hit start workout NOTHING happens stays stuck on blank screen 😔😔
"The app doesn't do what they advertise. There is literally zero personalisation and all the exercises are geniric with no progression. Dont buy anything in it, its not worth it. You'd be better of investing in your own training plan and educating yourself. And no, your customer service is not customer focused nor useful."
Dumb
Did not like it. Not flexible and cannot add cardio days
"The 14 days money back guarantee is deceiving and illegal in most countries. If you find out that the app misrepresented it's refund policy, contact your bank and contest the charge. Also, mark reviews warning you of this as helpful in Google Play, and report this app (Flag as inappropriate) for Google to review it and take further action. The app does not work for me, so I can't use the refund policy since I must use the app for 14 days to request a refund, which is impossible if you can't."
Flagged my bank account for fraud
"Tvfhis is a half baked app and not ready for real users; 1. It does not allow you to enter your workout equipment. 2. Since it doesn't have your equipment, it cannot give you a custom work out plan that's designed for you. 3. The alerts don't make any sense for EST time zone and cannot be adjusted. To top it off, I cancelled my subscription the day after I was charged for renewal and so far they have refused to refund the unused renewal citing internal policy procedure. Worst experience ever."
Didn't want to use this service but took payment anyways leaving me short on money
"The workouts as a whole are fine, but nothing about the workout plans or meal plans give me a personal touch. It's like they ignore half of the sign up parts and just give you what you need based on equipment or not, and weight goal. I can't eat most of the food on the meal plans, and can't do half of the workouts they give me per session. Waste of money when I can get the same workouts for free on other apps."
"ad said it was affordable, it is not"
"This app is the classic cash grab through IG advertisement. A good comparison would be Norton Antivirus. Provides no benefits over just doing some of your own research, or using a more popular personal workout builder app. The cost and subscription service is appalling. 1 star isn't low enough."
"This app needs some serious work.. the workouts aren't balanced and the voiceover is way off. I'll be on ""round 3"" for 3 round straight. It tells me I have 10 sec left when I'm really already in a break.. has potential, but pretty half baked as it stands"
I was going to start with a week but it selected the 3 month plan and I'd like a refund because i have canceled my account
"For how simple of an app it is, there are many bugs with the HIIT workouts. Consitantly says 1 min rest on the screen when it's actually 30 seconds. Trainer is telling you theres only 15 seconds left of the workout when you're actually halfway through the rest period. All the workouts are gym class excersizes. Not creative and pretty boring, to be honest. Jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, no variations. Expected more for a paid program. Im not going to even get into the meal plan. Not using it."
"Hmm how to say a bit dissepointed with so little option after seeing the ads, the workout is refreshing and nice but very little challange option then competever off the app, and it would been nice if there was more logs could see like what excersise was used and what muscle the excserise works, like the interface almost only reason gave it 3 star and not 2, excuse me for my bad english."
"I don't like that the workouts are only from start to finish. I enjoy tracking the workout myself, just give me the template and let me click when a set is finished, and move on to the next. The way the workout just ""plays"" in time is not functional or user friendly. Should be more of a checklist type of workout to keep track of what you've done."
"Joined it for the guided nature of the workouts, but after joining was curious to the cancelation process and noticed it was not as easy as it seems in regards to cancelling which to me is a red flag. Quick to get your subscription fee but makes you wait 72hrs for a cancellation email. All in all you can probably do better on your own if you have a basic understanding of working out and eating well. I wouldn't recommend the app."
"RUN AWAY! They don't offer a trial, I paid for the plan and didn't like it, asked for a refund on the very same day, and also never used the app. After a week of waiting they say they can't refund it. Very disappointed."
SCAM It will start a 30 day subscription without telling you and even telling you! No phone number to speak to anybody just an internal emailing system Do not download unless you want to pay a £30+ monthly subscription
It only works if you have Wi-Fi. Otherwise is worthless 🙂.
"SCAM! WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY After taking a trial and cancelling almost immediately and receiving confirmation I had cancelled, after 3 months I was charged 29.99. After reaching out for a refund, I was informed Mad Muscle would only give 50% refund!! Several attempts to respond to support team and raising new support tickets...no response. Absolutely disgusting. Scam. Avoid at all costs. Reported to my bank and to Google Play. CONTACTED SUPPORT MANY TIMES AND THEY DONT RESPOND AFTER FIRST EMAIL!"
Scummers.
"Make sure to read their fine print on refund policy . Kind of bait and you are trapped . App is not worthy to charge subscription, just another way to waste dollars without any benefit . There are other better apps out their that are free also . Will not recommend to anyone ."
It's a scam. Eventually you'll end up paying for a month due to not being able to cancel the subscription in time.
"3 day split when I was looking for a 6 day split with zero way to choose my split ratio. I can say with zero doubt this is hands down the most disappointing fitness app I have ever used. Edit: This app is a full on scam. Zero customization on what you're actually looking for in a workout and their ""money back guarantee"" does not apply if you realised how horrible their plan is. Also no way to directly cancel sub beyond directly emailing them. STAY CLEAR OF THIS APP."
"Gives me the workout I always wanted, however the topic is change your workout, but you can't as I wanted a more intense workout for my abs, but no way to get it?"
"I started my fitness journey 2 weeks ago. I weighed 245 and decided I wanted to better my life. I found this app and decided to give it a shot, and I'm very happy I did. After 1 full workout week, I weigh 239.6. Consistency is key along with a healthy diet, but the workouts are fantastic I feel better every day! Thank you!"
"After downloading and subscribing for 3 months I wanted to cancel the subscription to stop the auto renewal, which was double the price once it ended. The option to cancel wasn't provided till the 2nd day. The subscription didn't pop up on my Google play account either and I still don't know why, so I couldn't cancel there. I haven't started using the app yet, so I cannot speak to the results of my program. Please fix the cancel issue, people should have that option from day 1."
This app is deducting my credit card without my knowledge as i didnt request for any subscription. Its a scam
The workout video is terrible and i don't see a specific program or day. How do you even start the program. Will cancel in ten minutes if this lousy video is the program.
"Doesn't record the steps. Sometimes the app doesn't all to make updates. It doesn't provide the history of the workouts and reports. The work out plan is supposed to help me increase weight and monitoring, but looks like I am losing weight instead."
"Your money back policy is absolute scam! How can I use the app 14 days in a row and prove that with a screenshot, if I didn't like and deleted the app immediately! I clearly stated that I DID NOT use the app in any manners. I'm going to sue you if you don't give my money back!"
Abusive with personal data
"The best exercise, nutrition, and wellness app on the market. The app is easy to use and adaptable to where you are at fitness wise. The best part is the meal plans to go when the work outs which if you are willing to see it through its suoer effective. Highly recommend!"
I was charged $30 and now can't find a way of canceling and deactivating my subscription. It stated it would only cost $16.99.
So far so good but when your filling out the initial questionnaire it's asking about food likes and once you pay for the plan your meal plan is separate from what you thought was included
It doesn't accurately track your workouts.
"Their meal plan doesn't work out for me as I am a vegetarian. After first few minutes of subscription I realized I cannot use this so I requested a refund. It's been a week and they don't refund my money. Update: they found a vegetarian preference, but they won't refund your money. Such programs as these need atleast 1 day free trial. While subscription they don't give any of these details, but while requesting cancellation they throw a refund policy at you. Extremely unhappy with them."
Confusing Frustrating
"Seems to have potential, but can't unsubscribe from their app/website. If you want to only use dumbbells, the app will add resistance bands as their ""basic"" equipment. You can't select only dumbbells which is a shame. Edit : you need to wait 2-3 days before seeing the unsubscribe button."
"It's a nice app if you need some sort of direction to get you working out, it also teaches you a lot of really good exercises but it's not really made for your typical gym goer, though. The app almost assumes you have your own gym with full equipment. If you use a normal gym like the other 97% of us, it's going to easily double the amount of time these workouts take with all the wait time and walking around to different machines."
Absolutely horrific. Does not have basic features like tracking what weight was used in the exercise. Rest timer stops if you sleep the phone or minimize the app. Has 4 minute long instruction videos that you can move through manually. Refund policy is basically a scam under EU law. You either have to provide your personal videos/photos to shady third party or you can't refund. They claim EU citizens waiver their right for a refund the second they pay for subscription. Ridiculous.
"I like the app. It should provide an option to download the workout without videos, sometimes a guy doesnt have speedy internet. Second it should allow you to look back at previous workouts/ history. I am currently traveling with poor internet/connectivity combined with slow/large download files the app has become almost unusable. Thus the downward revision of app"
"I've had better results from other free work out programs, however I thought I'd go with this one for the meal plan. You'll select what you can and can't eat and regardless you'll just get whatever. Overly complex meals with a bunch of random ingredients. I have time but not that much time."
Charged me 37.95 I never agreed to
Charged me after I canceled my subscription
"App doesn't work, can't login and cancel subscription, can't open anything from their site because you don't have a profile login only a support login. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
"Disgusting, the app works awful during workouts, and to put cherry on the top, 3 days after installing it doesnt work. I need an answer and a solution straight away if not i expect my full refund"
Scamer I cancelled my subscription before renwal but they charged my credit card.
App won't open on s23 ultra brand new phone..... worked good for first workout then poop
100% cancelled my subscription to this app and then received a fraud alert that they tried to charge me anyway. Super cool guys!
Can't sign up because you force me to select a grain and veggie.
"SCAMMER ALERT!!! Paid for 1 month but they kept charging me afterwards. Cancelled the subscription through my PayPal and tried to email them to fix the issue but never recieved a reply. If you like your money stolen, make sure to download and subscribe 👍"
"Overall this app has been very helpful to help me with my fitness and nutrition. However, there are some features that could be improved, especially if you want to swap an exercise or meal for another. There's no way to search or filter in these situations so you end up scrolling through an endless list of options. There's no ability to log what weight you can lift or how many reps/sets you actually did."
easy and user friendly
Pay to play.
"The application is lacking in customization. By default, the app sets workout sessions every other day. However, that schedule doesn't work for everyone. You can move some of the days around but you cannot additional days. After I realized this, I cancelled the subscription and requested a refund within minutes of signing up. It was declined as I needed to use the app for 14 days and have video proof. Buyer beware: the company is sketchy. I don't recommend this to gym goers, maybe a beginner"
very interesting and helpful
"Refused to let me cancel my subscription even though your support says I should be able to under ""help"" - ""subscription"" - ""Cancel my subscription"". Not even a trial period to see if it's what you want to spend your money on."
"I was under the impression meal planning was part of what I paid for not true, it requires to pay more... I do like having a set plan in place for workouts, but it took me from 5 days down to 3 days of workout? Plus some things I can't access like steps and a few other things..."
"Cancellation policy not clear on the app, at least for me, but when I contacted the support team, they were really helpful and refunded my money back .. Thank you"
After I explained that I have a accident before I get charge for a full month after a week subscription the last think you remember is cancel a subscription and you get a hold of then and they said we can reimburse you for a full month's subscription you got charge. So before you sign up whit this app shop around to get better customer service not a company that tryst to keep your money.
Somewhat problematic
The app take money from my account for next month and i don't have setup direct debit! not good don't use not safe!!!!
"Tried it for 2 days, didn't like it, and requested a refund. Was told that because it hadn't been 14 days, they couldn't refund me the money. This is a scam company, don't waste your time or your money"
"Beware, this will not show up as a subscription on your Google play, but they will charge your PayPal account."
"Terrible experience. Customer service is only a bot, you pay a minimal fee at beginning and then quadrupled a month later... without any notice. You are constantly asked to join their nutrition plan."
"great app to begin working out with, doesn't try to kill you like others I have tried, I am going to use this for a long time"
"Beware and stay out of this app, this is a scam, the company is registered in Cyprus and the app purposely removed the unsubscribe button. You'll get charged twice for something that you didn't sign up for. They will turn you around in circles to unsubscribe, beware. Totall scam !"
This app sucks. Overpriced and won't let you cancel subscription
I bought the app and now it just charged me for no reason at all €31
"Very poor, they will take your money and you can't get a refund even if you don't use it"
"Cost and app are shady. The app forced me to sign up for the meal plan and I did not want this option. I was not notified and then had 2 separate bills. I immediately canceled and asked for a refund and they refused. I contacted them and they said their policy - does not allow this. DO NOT BUY THIS. *** After 2 weeks of communications, still have not refunded me. And now they respond to contact customer support which I did - many times!!!"
"Downloads take too long. Got motivated and went to start the workout, 30mins later after waiting for the stupid app to download the workout it freezes. Now I have lost motivation and can't be arsed with the rest if it. I want a refund"
"3 workouts in and this app barely functions. There's not a buzzer to let you know when to set up for the next exercise. The (animal) workout does not have the proper exercise on the screen, it just keeps showing the same thing inch worms exercise over and over again. I would not recommend this to anyone."
"Doesn't let you change anything, can never get a live coach and looks like a rip off scam!"
"I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now. I really enjoy the workouts and appreciate the supporting videos. The pacing between routines is usually very good, but some workouts can move a little quickly from a given routine to the next... alternately, the videos for some routines can run a bit long. While this app suits my needs well, if you are looking for an app with any kind of tracking look elsewhere. This is useful as a workout app only. [Note: I am not on the meal plan.]"
You have to buy the subscription to see if the app is for you. I tried getting a refund literally 20 mins after purchasing the subscription upon realizing this app does not allow you to customize your workout plan. I was denied my refund even though their policy states you can receive a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the subscription.
"The whole changing an exercise function is just a mess. A bunch of exercises in a row you want to change, but they give you sets as option. So 5 exercises to be changed turn into 5x 3sets of an exercise."
It is always helpful to have a guided program. This one is pretty good and it helps keep you accountable. However the assistant is pretty useless. Clearly they only have a chat bot and zero human support. Even as a chat bot it's clearly very simple. You can't ask any unique questions. Also there is zero ability to edit anything. The app is not at all customizable. I did a work out. It didn't register. Now I can't figure out how to check it off. Can't figure out how to change my starting weight.
"Clever AI, but I'm sick of the constant notifications, emails and the price! Deleted after 1 day."
"Predatory refund policy You can't get a refund unless you prove you used the app for at least 14 days with videos. Don't be fooled by the 30 days money back guarantee that they provide. Moreover since I am from EU I can and will take legal action if they do not provide a refund, regardless if they say that I have withdrew any right since I made the purchase."
I spent 15 minutes filling out a survey where I told it that I am unable to complete a pull-up. Day 1 basic workout includes pull-ups. Why did I pay $25 for a personalized workout plan that ignores my capabilities when it explicitly asked for them?
"The cost was $25 for a 6 week plan. I thought I would try it. I had a good experience using the app and following the plan. After six weeks they charged me again $53+ for no apparent reason. The app has no notifications for payments nor links to ""account manager"" to review the status of my payments. I will have to dispute the charge and hope for a refund."
"Great fit app. I'm enjoying the workouts and love how they are low impact but makes me sweat, gets my heart rate up and makes me feel it!"
Never subscribe for the trial. They never return your money. Youtube is far better or if you want to spend some money. Try fitbot.
La aplicación no cuenta con un menú para remover la información de la tarjeta de crédito ni psrw cancelar la suscripción. Es una estafa que eso suceda.
"Watch out for auto-renewal. Canceling subscription/turning off auto-renewal is buried in app. Nothing on turning off auto-renewal or canceling in FAQ, support, or Account sections. It's really shady. They won't refund your money if payment goes through. I swore I turned auto-renewal off. You will only get a response saying it's in the agreement. You clicked agree. So watch out. App rating suspicious. Over 8k reviews, no matter how good an app is there should be more of a spread between 1-5 stars"
"SCAM! Not what I signed up for and reduced priced ""deal"" isnt, check you back accout you will have multiple charges of 3x. It is a Cleverly designed ad inside of another app of the same genre and makes you think you are on that app. I didnt even realize I had signed up for the wrong service until prompted to install the new app. I immediately cancel and emailed customer service. O they are very sorry that they can't refund you, but hey they will comp you 2 months for allowing them to cheat you."
"I've been using mad muscles for 1 week. They have started me off slow, and I've really enjoyed it. I have made workout routines in the past myself, but have had a hard time sticking with it. I paid 15 bucks for 3 months, and am thinking it was a great decision. The financial part is helping with my accountability, and I've had no issues with staying motivated. The workouts are fitting for my skill and body type, and I've been feeling great. Highly recommend!"
"It's a scam, they over charge you and the won't cancel your subscription. They just keep charging you. Can't talk to anyone, just a computer"
"Seems OK, could be better by having a way to log weights used and number of reps achieved"
It's like having your private coach. It is an excellent way of doing exercises.
Very expensive. DEFINITELY not the kind of money I'd throw at an app that is this sketchy.
Careful! This app is not forthcoming about the price you will pay and since you sign up outside of the app you will not see your subscription in Google Play store. The cancellation policy acts like an American gym with 30-day notice. App jumped from $15 to $30 and there was no notice that I was still actively subscribed and due for a renewal payment. Actively seeking a refund for the $30 I was charged without notice - it should be easy to get $ back yet it's like arguing with Comcast...
Takes forever to download workout
"Don't pay for this product, I've unsubscribed and yet it still billed me 42 dollars Canadian and I it still won't let me unsub now"
"Im very unhappy becouse it automticsly make me future subsciption i never want just wanna try it for a week... Strongly not recommend it. Its robbering app. Re: аfter a week a delete it i have a lot ot injuries so is not compatible for me, from all i found and try the best is T.h.e.n.X. Btw thanks to team for fast cancel my subscriprion."
Seemed great until I used the app. 20 mins later I cancelled. Can't change original weight. I can't even change my weight goal. Seriously? Who's paying who? I thought I was at least able to change nutrition start date as it may be a bit difficult to find a lot of the food - one of two things happen and neither of them are actual updates. Either it says it's updated but the date never changes. Or it changes and then resets when the app is closed. Kinda garbage
"App is very pricy and has a confusing cancelation process. The workout guides were half baked and uninformative. The videos didn't play correctly when I was in the workout, and offered no guidance on how to do the exercise."
"Very poor app, doesn't let you select how many times x week do you want to train, neither select the duration of the training, moreover the support its hopeless"
"Scam to get credit card info plus will charge you 39$, then surprise charge you 49.99 a month, and you seem to not be able un subscription through google"
The meals option within the app says no internet connection. When clearly I have one.
"Do not let them fool you. Once you pay, they will find a way to keep your money. I let them know their app didn't work for me the day I downloaded it and they still stiffed me. I'm going to have to file a fraud claim with my CC. These people are not worth the risk. I reached out to the support team and they told me I was not entitled to a refund even after having the app for less than a day. 2 hours actually. So, yes, this is a scam. Buyers beware."
"Don't do it, once you purchase the subscription they want additional money for the meal plan, impossible to get a refund. Not even tried the app nor will I ever. I will have to eat the $15. Refund was requested immediately when I saw they wanted extra money for the meal plan which was never advertised that I could see"
"It is a great program! A lil too expensive for me at the moment and I'm not going to the gym as much due to work, so I had to quit and uninstall. But it is amazing when I was using it"
Good if you need a schedule and assigned workouts. It better than you trying to get a plan together and sticking to it. since you paid for it you force yourself to use it lol.
Can't even get through the quiz.
"Must apply membership to use, no free trial or anything"
"The workout plans are great. Like others say, the app doesn't always log your workouts. I would love it if we could say how each specific part of the workout was, to track if I am doing better with squats/etc. I would love some sort of statistics saying how many of each exercise I did and what difficulty I ranked them at. I am keeping it for the workout plans, challenging but doable, but I am tracking my progress on my own, so I am unsure if I will renew my subscription once my 3 mo. finish."
The work outs are good but the app won't run in the backround so I can't work out and change the screen to even change a song because the workout will just stop until I hit play again. And then when I hit play again the work out restarts. Lame. At this point I just look at what work outs I'm doing for the day and do em with out running em In the app.
They wont unsubscribe me and keep trying to charge me. I had to put a stop on them. And now disputting a reocurring monthly charge
"👎👎Very bad customer care . Payed by mistake, and they are refusing my refund request that I submitted after the payment directly. I am not using the service. Why they are Refusing !!!!!????? 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎don't use it"
I wasn't even looking for this app it appeared while I was using another one. I thought I was still on my app when I pushed on a subscription to be surprised that I made a new subscription. I don't recommend it.
Terrible app is almost useless and charged me $44 dollars when the first month I paid 15. There was no information about the amount changing
lol ukrainian flag
My son is autistic and 14 he purchased this app and i explain that. However they still will not cancel and refund my money. Also definitely not a good app from what I had seen .
Workout never shows up can't log weight
Repetitive and boring exercises. Not convinced.
"I paid for the 6 mo subscription and ended up not using the app at all, but 6 mo later was automatically billed. Since I had forgotten about the autopay, I reached out to customer service the same day and was given the run around that there was nothing they could do. They forwarded me along and again, nothing. I'll take blame for the autopay, and forgetting about it, but to not honor a refund because it's against their rules when I tried to cancel the same day it renews is bad customer service."
Fácil de usar. Muy explicativa. Me encanta!
How to change my subscription or cancel it? This is nowhere to be found! It has been deducting money forever without giving an option to cancel it. No help from the team either.
Free to download but got to pay for any additional workouts etc... so can't go forward without making a payment to continue the programme.
This app is a scam. Please beware. Please donot pay them first wothout knowing about the app. I am very much disatisfied. I wish I could lodge a formal complaint and get my money back. I tried mny times but evrytime I got rejected. Please pleaase make sure you are away from this.
"Room for improvement, They could give a estimated weight range for each set based off of a max. They could also give more exercise swap options including more equipment. Might just do 1 month and then cancel."
No place to track set or weights cant go back to days passed if missed a workout which happened to.me as app wasn't downloading workouts
"Use Muscle Booster instead of Mad Muscle I got into this app put in my perference and all. My frist day was a rest day. Not sure how this work but for Mad Muscle it make sense. I asked them for a refund but according to their policies they can't give my money back. Thats all hood to me, I found Muscle Booster and the meal plan is free!"
"Not worth the 15 bucks. My gym has limited signal and the app doesn't allow you to download the workouts ahead of time. Considering all the free information out there, the app doesn't deliver."
"I can't cancel my subscription, and support don't answer to my emails. They charge me every month 40$ and I could not cancel now."
Meal options are extremely limiting and dont offer alternatives for allergies like eggs or shellfish. Workout regimens are excessively simple and dont follow with goals selected for your personal journey. I knew it was a gamble but my money was wasted.
Horrible customer service. I used the app for 5 min until I realized it was garbage. I asked for measly $15 refund because they advertise a money back guarantee and it took 2 days for them to respond asking if they could get more details. After replying another 2 days rolls around and they ask for even more details. This wasn't good enough for them that I didn't like the app or the excercises they provided. Don't support this company.
"Simply put a scam. They hook you in with a low price and don't state clearly, that it will be put up automatically. When emailed, you'll get something like this and no chance of a refund: Our service is subscription-based. Unless canceled, the 30-days introductory plan for 3.99 GBP automatically converts to the monthly subscription at the full price of 29.99 GBP. You should have canceled your subscription at least 24 hours before the renewal date in order not to be charged for the service."
Can't even customize exercises. Chat does not have option to speak to a human and the AI is pretty dumb
"App is great, experience better than expected. Is there a possibility to add to the program other external activities (ex: every Tuesday i go 15km by bike and 1-2 hours basketball)? Thanks."
"So broken app, it's usually stuck on lunch screen. Loads slowly and unresponsive. I use a phone with snapdragon 8 gen 1+, 16Gb of ram and android 12. I restart this app many times to just lunch. And to unsubscribe is also a hard thing, just go here and press unsubscribe. That did not even exist before I contacted you about it and it just appeared from nowhere. Seems like a scam app."
"**AVOID** Less then mediocre service. I bought it on purpose once, but then made the mistake of accidentally deleting the app before unsubscribing and got charged again. When I asked for a refund, I got refused because I missed their ARBITRARY 24-hour window, despite being on vacation without internet when receiving the renewal notice. Now they are refusing to give me my money back because they're CLEARLY so DESPERATE. **AVOID** TLDR; their terms state they don't have to give a refund so byeeeee"
"Recommendation: Look somewhere else; don't get; don't subscribe Subscription-based (money-back guarantee made in bad faith given restrictive policies) 1) Data heavy 2) No download option 3) Buggy If app crashes mid-workout, you have to start from the beginning"
DO NOT DOWNLOAD! THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY! YOU CAN'T CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION!!!!
"A lot more could be included on this to make it more user-friendly. The workouts are timed, but only the resting period should be timed. There's nowhere to log your weights, so you have to do additional work to monitor your progress. The food plan is ridiculous and is not backed by science. I put my goal as to gain, and the protein amount per meal was too much. You can not digest 130g of protein in one sitting. Would stay clear if you are brand new to fitness"
"The app is ok, but charging a customer $30 for a subscription that they did not sign up for is not ok. I purchased a 1 week ($6.93) workout plan. Why would I be charged $30 and I did not sign up for the month workout plan, if anything they should have charged me $6.93 for another week or not at all. The refund process is total bs. I wouldn't recommend doing business especially when they have these shady practices."
So boring. Waste of money. I found way better workouts on YouTube for free. Disappointing
"They will charge you more money than stated, definitely feels like a scam. Stay away."
Hard to cancel. i don't like the ux
Always hard to open.
My one star is not for the app itself but for their customer service and refund policy. I decided to not use the app after my one month trail and they autochangerd me £31 pounds without giving me adequate notice. When I cancelled and asked for a refund they refused claiming I didn't meet the terms and conditions for a refund. Surely not wanting to use their app any longer is grounds for cancellation and a refund.
"I can't access my workout despite having paid, I can't seem to unsubscribe either cause the keep deduction my account! I still can't unsubscribe from this app, I have sent an email and nothing has been done to assist, but my account keeps getting deducted. The app doesn't appear on my ""Subscription"" list on Gooplay as you have indicated. I am pissed by how much of a scam this is!!"
"I wanted to cancel my subscription, and received a large logo stating a 30 day money back guarantee. But instead I had to do it for 14 consecutive days, have proof of this, and my reason for canceling cannot be a monetary issue. I had a bad experience with this refund policy. My reasoning was that I was unable to pay 15 dollars a month, so I was planning on going back to my original 6 days a week full body workout."
Don't lie in your advert!
The app has alooott of bugs and idk why but it keeps saying downloading when I open the exercise. About the meal plans there are less to no customizations worst app I've ever tried.
"Everything is in the Android app, no website experience. While the app is great for workouts, when it comes to meal plan, your phone is at risk to be damaged in the kitchen while trying to prepare your meals. Either improve your app UX or make the app available in web format so we can share the image on a bigger screen, or print option, while preparing the food. No one wants to struggle to scroll up & down, or zoom in & out with sticky fingers on a small screen. Tried this at my own expense."
I don't find this app helpful at all. It hard to actually talk to anyone other than generic questions.
Dodgy charges
NO COMMUNICATION
"I have had multiple knee surgeries on both knees and am not capable of doing half of the the exercises that was supposed to be tailored for me. When i requested a refund it was stated that i needed to try 2 weeks and show that i completed the workouts. How can i, if i cant do them? Complete waste of money."
"Doesn't keep my streak, I finish workout and attempt extra but doesn't count the day as having completed the workout. The program is gives feels just right."
Definitely one of the best workout apps I've ever had. I'd recommend to anyone looking for 5star excellence 💯
"Once a plan is set its impossible to change, the plan has me working out 3 times a week and I work out 5 times a week. It's not stated that after the initial 25£ for 3 months you automatically sign into a subscription for 59£ either!"
Not detailed or alternative harder or easier options
"This app is a SCAM ,! Took an extra £15.19! Out of my account before I noticed ! Transaction name they use is Amomedia media and if you try contact them the email bounces straight back , once I googled it other people have been charged various amounts they did not agree to !!! AVOID"
"Really unhappy with customer service. There is no way to cancel the subscription and the customer service response just tells you to go to the non-existent cancel subscription page. The app is okay, but there is no way to move ahead in videos for something like cooldown or warm-up which is disappointing."
Beginers app. Very hard to cancel.

"Gives the impression when you sign up that the meal plan is included. It's not. You have to pay separately for a meal plan and workout plan. Plus, I selected the option that I had a full range of gym equipment so that my plan would be made accordingly, but every exercise is bodyweight/resistance bands/dumbells. I hit a plateu and was looking for ideas to advance my workouts. This will work for someone who wants to pay for both plans and has limited equipment, but not for me."
Meal plan : overcomplicated - No weekly shop - Cant pick your favourites. Exercise : No option to limit the equipment to what you have - Assessment is basic. Will update after month to see how its going.
"Scam, takes your money but won't allow access via app. No response from ""customer service"", don't install. Google play should not carry. Response below says to contact customer service. I HAVE, NO RESPONSE!!!!!!!!!"
Programs good but glitches and no tech help
"App doesn't let you record weight, reps etc. You click on start workout and it just cycles through the routines without allowing you to input anything"
Overrated. It looks great on the surface but there are cheaper apps that do more for you. They also love to make it hard to cancel your subscription and charge your card even though you've already cancelled the subscription.
Is there anything free?
"The app itself is good, good exercises and meal planning. However the cost is too high, and it doesn't help when they double charge! I've been dealing with the ordeal of having two charges equating to almost AU$150!! Thats ridiculous! I paid for the first 3 month subscription, it didn't stick too well, and forgot about it, no big deal, i wasn't too upset. After that first 3 months it renews and I see it on my bank balance. I asked for a refund. They said that that's not covered."
Do not subscibe to this app you cannot cancel or stop auto renew
nice
"This app is horrible... Customer service is completely useless... The app does not allow you to log the weights you use OR reps completed... I used it for about 3 minutes and realized it was a worthless app... When I asked for a refund, the customer service took almost 3 weeks to get back to me, then refused to refund anything... what a waste of money!"
I just go to the gym
"it's got some good body weight plans, weight plans, and in between. I've been doing it for about 2 weeks so far. the videos explaining exercises are nice. the timer for exercises is in app so that's nice."
Solo me arroja entrenamientos de tres días a la semana y yo quiero ir 4 ¿Cómo puedo cambiar esto?
"It is a good app wish i could log my other excersises also. Since somtimes I do not miss a day. I just do barbell over press, barbells rows, barbell dead lifts, dumb bell flies, dumb bell rows, also resistance band workouts."
"!!! I won't be using this again. Too many bugs. !!! The workout and meal programs are decent, and the ui is user-friendly. I wish the meal plan was a little more customizable after setup, such as selecting or deselecting certain foods for allergies or preferences. **Edit: cannot change nutrition start date or workout start date (I have too many workouts trapped in a single week) **edit: changed what dishes I wanted to put on my plan and it reset when I reopened the app."
Good app. But please at a timer beep after the end of each excersie and each workout. It would be helpful for us to know that the time has ended while doing excersie like plank. I will change the rating once the change is done
Best way to challenge yourself to be more healthier
It's food for new people but the price is to much just fot 1 month an you have to pay extra for the meal plans its just not worth it
The meal plan is limited and has high cost to commit to that is unrealistic for single parent homes trying to make ends meet and the refund policy should be amended at least for the meal plan as you aren't aware the cost until after sign up.
"Asking me to pay before I can even browse what's in it. Not sure how this app has 5* on here of all the reviews are 1*. Absolute scam, beware."
"So far all has been good, one problem on my Samsung Note 20 ultra I can find the app, like it's downloaded and I have an account but the app icon doesn't show up anywhere in my apps screen. I have to open Google play and open it from there. Which is weird. Edit: found it, thank you"
"1. The transition between exercises is too fast. Sometimes one exercise is on the floor and you have to quickly move up to start the next. A 5 seconds pause before the next is welcome. Sometimes they ask for 10 reps, but I am able to cover only 8 without losing the next exercise 2. A separate volume control of the instructor and Spotify is welcome. Otherwise it's impossible to hear both. 3. A note at the bottom saying ""up next"" is welcome."
Solo son videos y ni los resúmenes ni nada funciona guía nutritiva hay que pagar y eso no lo dicen mejor ver videos en Youtube
Not practical... The app assumes a fluent workout as if the gym is empty and everything is ready for me. Changing the order of exercises within a workout is not possible. The app also doesn't provide any instructions for how much weight one should use in each exercise.
I put in that I had no equipment and it just keeps giving me workouts with equipment
Totally bunk. Tried for a month. First month was 15. Now I'm getting charged 40 bucks. Application doesn't help with real meal ideas or an actual work out. Just make your own plan. Way cheaper. Trying to cancel is made difficult.
Hello I left a complaint to your support team about canceling my subscription because of issues with finance I would appreciate it if this can be looked at and if my subscription can be ended thank you
"Don't download this, unless you read the policy."
Very clear instructions and excellent demonstration videos of each exercise. Just what I need.
Poor app poor customer support
Thumbs down 👎
"SCAM! Website lies about how to cancel. Followed clear instructions to cancel my account after finding out that they are going to charge me double, and was lead to a dead end. It was literally blank where the 'cancel subscription' option is supposed to be. Not reputable. I messaged customer service, but won't hear back for 3 days, in which time I can be charged again. Read online reviews. Total scam."
No Customer Support! I've sent three different emails. Two through the app with questions and one directly to their support desk to cancel my subscription and never get a response. I tried to use the app and the workout would not download while I was at the gym. I did a whole separate workout and and the workout in the app still hadn't completed downloading. I requested to cancel my trial because I don't feel this app is for me and can I get anyone to get back to me. It's very frustrating.
"I paid for a week subscription, 6 days later, NOT 7 DAYS LATER, I was charged £30.99 for a month automatically without my say so, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!"
"I had to delete my profile, to cancel subscription, although I sent email to them earlier, they just cancelled it once I deleted! Not so user friendly"
"Tried my first workout, but it didn't load the exercises. Stayed at the gym for 1.5 hours and still... didn't load. Great investment haha did better just watching the buff guys exercise and mimicked them."
"I subscribe to a subscription that will be charge every week but the deduct for a week and I can't find my work plan but since I cant access my workout plan have unsubcrib but I wrote this, plz don't deduct any amount from my account anymore ooo"
"My workouts are good, although after i finish one workout, it doesn't check completed after I'm done on my calendar portion on top counting the days."
"This is a scam. I payed for this, then without opening the programme materials asked for a refund as I had changed my mind. They haven't refunded me yet. No response from the app or email yet."
It takes money without any permission
Stay away from this scam! I bought the plan as advertised on Instagram. It's sold to look like a one time purchase. No info explicitly warning that it will turn into a subscription. It converted into a paid subscription at over €36 the next month. No email to inform you as to when or how much it would be & no option to cancel on the app. Phony rights waver statement within the app hidden in the menu. This behavior is disgusting! The app itself is average at best. Wouldn't pay this for it!
Not user friendly at all
Is this app free?
I am not happy at all. I have paid from 4 hours and I didn't receive my plan yet
Tried to get a refund after canceling service and was denied.
cheaters. you can't cancel your subscription
Support is poor
"Despite removing the subscription and cancelling, they kept attempting to charge my card each week for a random membership payment. I had to email them to cancel and still haven't heard back. Put a block on my card. Terrible design and predatory. ** Update: customer service points me to a dead end, and says that my subscription has been cancelled only for them to attempt another 70$ charge. Reported to Google. Like many people on here, may have to cancel my card. Do not use."
"Not worth the money. UI is garbage, plans are generic and impersonal. No meal plan unless you pay more. Do your self a favor, save the money and research for yourself"
The worst app. They want your money!! They make it hard to cancel and it's just not worth the money!! Customer service is a JOKE!
So it's got potential. Doesn't track enough and always says I've burned a set number of kcals no matter what I do. Can't go back and see anything I've previously done. Adding on to my last review. I have decided to remove this app for now and try something else. The notifications for meal planning is spammy and very annoying. I wish u could just not have that associated with the workout part. App needs more for the price. It's a good start but only if it was free with ads or very low price.
"Overall, good set of workout. I do not like how my 3 day a week workout functions on the app. Example I don't train on Wednesday but I do that exercise on Thursday. Even though I started the workout on a different day, it never saves my progress as completed. Please fix that."
"Read the terms carefully which I didn't before purchasing. Auto renewal at higher price is part of it, shall be an opt-in imho, but also it voids eu consumer withdrawal right. Canceling this isn't obvious and made abnormally uneasy and misleading. As for the exercises, when I specify bodyweight, I don't want to see 1st workout with 2x6l water bottles required. At least it has warmup/active cool down as part of the workout, but spamming with notification is horrendous."
It kept downloading forever in my gym. Gave it 2 honest tries. And the app had nowhere to request a refund.
App keeps freezing and will not load. After their developers response...I emailed the support contact they provided and received a message that the email was undeliverable as it is a bad domain. Trying to discontinue my membership now and having trouble finding a good contact.
I WANT MY CANCELATION OF SUBSCRIPTION
"I can't unsubscribe , follow the instruction to go to setting > subscription > manage > send but nothing happened. Have tried to send email to support but no response . Would like a full refund!"
"not customizable, meal plana doesn't work don't subscribe, complete rip off"
"Good workouts and delicious, easy to follow meals. It would be super helpful/efficient if the meals tab had a search function I could use to quickly look up a meals if I don't like what's being suggested."
Thought i had canceled but i apparently didnt... if you do the free trial and end up not liking it i strongly reccomend reassuring yourself that it cancels when you cancel it.
"The programs are good, and the demonstration films are excellent. The only problem I've had so far is trying to input the weights I'm using"
"Paid for a trial at @£6.93. Had a loom around the app and discovered its just a bunch of random, mostly body weight exercises that you can get anywhere online. Wouldn't have paid a penny for it. I sent numerous emails to cancel which they rec3and replied too, then took £30.99 from my account. Still hears nothing back from them. DO NOT go anywhere near this app"
love this app. So easy to use and really is a practical tool to make things so easy if your not knowledgeable in exercises or working specific muscle groups.. tutorials for each exercise help make it simple and easy to follow. Would love the meal access but a little pricey for me right now in my situation. Highly reccomended to get started and staying focused to be abetter me👌
Some of the hardest apps I've used to try to cancel a subscription I'm negative in my bank account due to it keep pulling the money out of my account do not use this app
"This app is garbage with even worse customer service. DO NOT BUY. They offer money back guarantee, unless they decide they don't want to. It is a cookie cutter workout system that is for beginners."
Not the best for proper form training. There's no way to properly calibrate the app to your training style or speed. The AI sets your speed and workouts with insufficient time to transition between exercises. I find myself rushing to keep up with app's pace with causes poor transitions and compromising my form.
"Please be aware that you are not able to cancel your subscription without contacting them, and it took almost a week to get a message back, so beware of their money grabbing techniques. The app itself is very basic, with very bad UI and UX, no personalisation to the exercises whatsoever. You can not even change your workout days. It just starts from the first day you get the app, and you can not make a default workout schedule, like mon wed fri."
"Very inflexible program that doesn't take account of days when you can't exercise. Also promised it had a money back guarantee, which doesn't apply to the Android version. Avoid."
I love it. at home workouts!
Is not free
I don't understand why this app has. 4.9 rating I scroll down and it was everyone giving it 1 to 4 stars
It asks me to pay but I have no idea what's inside
"Do not get this app, nothing is as described look at all negative one star comments and you will see what I am talking about. No need to explain.There is no money back guarantee. As soon as I purchased I realized that this app was a mistake, I canceled immediately. And was given the run around. Today i was charged $31.00 after I literally wrote them a page elaborating why I am canceling and in no way,shape or form do I want to continue with there service. Cancel my subscription, need my refund."
"They lied when they say that the plan is customized. They have a generic workout plan that they are giving regardless of the lengthy questionnaire. What a scam, also, not an easy to find out on how to end subscription so I don't get charged for this scam anymore"
Beware you have no control of canceling the subscription without contacting them. In the app it says manage subscription but there is no where to click to cancel as they direct you to in the instructions
Totally useless and committed Unauthorised use of my credit card. I can't cancel subscription
"Likely card fraud! Upon paying for a package through the app, several Toronto Uber charges showed up on my card overnight. The international assessment charge that came with the package also identified MadMuscles as located in Toronto. Do not make in-app purchases."
"Very nice app, recommend."
excellent plan built around what you want to achieve. moving in the right direction
"The worst subscription app ever,i will not recommend it to anyone.Avoid at all cost,you will end up paying for it even when you no longer use it"
"I was excited to get a personalized plan for a home workout using the equipment I have with avoiding knee heavy workouts. Welp, my first workout including jumping squats. I'm bummed I paid $50 to see a workout I can't do. Additionally, their refund conditions state that you must prove you did the workout for 14 days. Lastly, the process for canceling was confusing and predatory. The app is meh- there are much better ones for cheaper."
"I've been using this app for a week, and I've got to say I've been highly disappointed in it for a paid app. It is missing some key features that I would want, like tracking the weight I use per exercise. On top of that the plan is not great. It has the same workouts (Barbell squats, and barbell chest press) on every exercise day, which is not ideal. The videos are good, but that's about the only positive. It might be good for someone brand new to exercise, but even then there's no cardio days."
There should be a trial membership for people to experience what does the app provide.
Way to many notifications set to on as default. Can't figure out how to link my Samsung watch for steps. Downloaded Google fit to work with this app... nothing is working as I hoped. I'll give it another week before I unsub and delete
So I accidentally purchased a full version but i just wanted a trial version so i requested a refund the same day of purchase and they were 2 days answering and could not refund my purchase which is absurd
"Overall a decent app for at home workouts (can't speak for any other kinds of workouts provided). There are definitely some technical issues (e.g. sometimes the wouldn't count a workout even though I did it, this ending my streak), but I think it's acceptable for beginners and intermediates. With that being said, there are better options elsewhere. P.S. I hate the you can't cancel your subscription within the app."
"Still early, but my main issue I have is how confusing and incredibly frustrating tracking one's weight is. I try entering a weight for a precious date, and it enters it for the date one day earlier than I selected. It also does not make sense to even have to enter it manually when their is the option to sync the app with Google fit, and have one's weight tracked automatically, as it does with one's step count . If I don't see any improvement l, I'll be Uninstalling and ending the account."
You can input your information but for anything useful you have to pay to set up a plan. No free access to anything useful.
Nit very intiative....Too many breaks.
"Probably the worst app I have paid for, no track of weight, no way to make your own workout to work with you, a waste of money and a rip off in my opinion"
"Many exercises have the incorrect preview with the name. Example- name: bent over row, preview: man demonstrates dead lift. App may provide incorrect information to inexperienced gym goers. Some workouts unrealistic example- who does 5sets of 60reps for squats or crunches or pull ups?"
"It's great to use to learn some different at home exercises and how to structure them. I'm not sure how accurate any of the other information is such as calories, time, and streaks. For example, my steak randomly ends/continues on days incorrectly. Also it doesn't give you that much insight into how is actually working for you. It has an option to add Google fit but as far as I can tell that information doesn't add anything to either app."
"I thought the introductory plan was a one time payment. However, once a plan is completed it immediately turns into a subscription service $53.19 for this plan. I was charged on 12/18. There was no communication from them advising prior to the auto charge. I cancelled same day. Requested a refund, but their team refused and just sighted some policy. The team only refunded me after a lot of effort and leaving this review, which was now edited."
"Sees add, oh its free. Downloads it gives information. 35/month. Yea great job. Dont do it guys. Btw look on info ul see it ""in app payment"""
"The app is helpful and practical to use. The widget is especially useful for me, though I wish the water tracker was part of it to make it easier to quickly update you water intake."
"Uhhh... Got it due to searching for a workout, Not gonna lie I Uninstalled after seeing the first ""pre made"" workout they provided called Goldeb Biceps.. It had no bicep excercises.. Back squats aren't bicep exercises, crunches aren't biceps exercises, Bench press isn't primarily bicep exercises.. No thanks. !!!Edit: There is no way to cancel your subscription as well besides disputing via bank"
I've paid for 3 month service and still I'm bombarded constantly with notifications. This app is worse than an insecure girlfriend. Everytime I look at my phone there's another notification. One tells me to eat a snack and yet every recipe is locked because I didn't get the meal plan for $5.00/month. Why am I receiving those?
"If you're new to working out this will help you. If you know what you're doing, not going to provide anything new and different"
"They have very few leg workouts, like 4 maximum and none of them require equipment. Terrible if you are trying to workout your legs...unless you want to do 2 sets of jumping up and down 12 times at the gym."
Meal planning sucks does not account for food allergies and likes and dislikes. Workout program is built for an idiot I don't need a video of someone doing an exercise and it doesn't even have a log to track the amount of weights or reps listed. Don't waste your money.
This app is horse 💩 they took away the cancel subscription button and now they keep on charging my card I'll be reaching out to my CC company to report fraud
I download and register this app today. Lets see...
"Not finding it useful at all, I thought as seen in the previous version they would show us exercise for gym but nothing like that in this version. No trial version even and upset with already paid for it."
The workouts are straight up trash. If you want to run all over the gym and use a machine once our twice and try and megaset. It definitely not for a busy gym.
"I can t cancel subscription in app its not Ok. Dont buy plan if you wont subscription which you cant easily cancel. You can buy in 1 clik but not cancel 1 clik, its not Ok. You cant even see subscription on google account. Teribble app."
I can't change my payment method and eventhough i cancel my subscription money still deducted
App is ok but needs more flexibility
Doesn't give a workout plan. Swear my plan was for someone in there 30s and I was honest on the assessment questionnaire.
Does not remind you of when to work out and it always sends notifications saying do this with this meal plan that you have to pay additionally to unlock waste of money would not recommend.
WATCH YOUR ACCOUNT. I paid what I thought was one time initial fee but turned out they charged me 30.00 a month. Luckily for me my bank caught the charge and suspected it as fraud so I was able to dodge that bullet but beware.
"It's a SCAM!!! DO NOT make a puchase!!! Cheaters ane liars! I made an ordered for a daily meal routine for 15$ and that was all I wanted. A month later I was charged 30$ for a monthly subscription that I have never did!!! After contacting the support by email to cancel the subsription, (that is the only way) I asked them why I have been charger for a monthy subscription that I've never made and the answer was ""it's all written in the terms of agreement when you made the puchase""! No refund!"
Wasted money...
"Terrible app. I have reached out to customer service to discontinue payments after they removed the cancel subscription from the app. Literally you have no way to control your subscription. I can not get a reply back. I will have to cancel the credit card and have it reissued just to stop them from charging my account. Exercise plan is the exact same exercises day after day, and they don't even count as completed at the end. Total waste of money. Continued to have my emails ignored weeks later."
Workout training are too advanced. It cant connect with any apps or my phone. Not user friendly.
"Utterly confusing account and billing info; which is a shame because it was stupid easy to sign up. The lack of transparency around what I'm actually paying for (I signed up for nutrition as an add on, but the subscription info has no such separation under the account), doesn't make me feel confident I went end up paying for services I'm not using. Had high hopes😑"
You can find free apps with the same workouts and challenges. The meals they say to eat aren't appealing at all. Cottage with anything and everything.
Worst possible app experience there's no sound or timers that go off and you have to look at your phone throughout the workout since there is no sound also the refund policy is ridiculous yo u have to contact Google or Apple to get a refund and they just send you in a loop and you will never get your money back horrible app do not install
My favourite app. Works like a charm. Amazing meals. Awesome fitness training. So amazing.
Just been notified by my bank that an attempt was made to take £29.99 from my account. I wasn't expecting this and if there's some sort of autosubscruption then it wasn't made clear enough to me and I want it cancelling immediately.
"Is not tailored to you at all, the food they tell you to eat is crazy. In my opinion this is a scam"
"This app is a scam. I used a discount plan for meal plan arounf 21usd, after 4 months, I was charged 53usd without my notice. Even so, the meal plan is not available in the app. It seems the app is intentionally developed in the way that the users will be auto charged money if they forget to remove auto charge function. Many same claims are declared. Google and see. Dont ever use this app."
"I always wanted to start working out, im 16 and I KNOW this is the place to start! I love it."
Needs to have option to add exercises to work outs. Needs to b able to log weight used and give u stats....would b perfect wt app on market.
Hi I think there is a bug with the apps could you please correct it
"Subscription service is awful. If you do not cancel with at least 24 hours notice (which has to be done via customer support), you'll have to pay for the whole month without any refund or flexibility whatsoever. I had to cancel my credit card because of this, its payment and customer support are very shady. On the other hand, the app has a good workout and meal program, nice design and really easy to follow, but for me, I'm better off going to a gym."
Was just charged 30.00 for a subscription. I'm here trying to cancel the damn thing!!!
Emailed them 2 times for a refund and no response yet. Customer service doesn't exist. Just learned that they made it difficult for people to get refund requiring you to take video of your workouts of you actually using the app and the training programs. That was not mentioned when you first signed up. What a joke!
I subscribed on a introductory price of $15.99/3 months but was charged $29.99/3 months
I would like for there to be an option to change the frequency of my workouts after I've created a plan. I now go to the gym 5 times a week instead of 3. And my workout plan is stuck on 3 workout days with 2 rest days that I cannot modify.
false adver on the price of subscription. they also make it almost impossible to cancel it.
It's OK but the exercises and meal plans aren't the best.
"Meal plan seems good would be better if it had more options for diet types keto etc. Biggest problem is you can't get a routine that is more than 3 days a week, and the gym option provides far more at home routines than ones with weights. Also you can't record your performance to track strength or stamina gains. Work out also are not very balanced. I had to pre iew 8 different days of workouts which is almoat 3 weeks worth before I could find a shoulder routine. Going to try for 25 days and see"
"Doesn't have options to manage my subscription. To cancel my subscription, I set them an email as documented in their website guidelines. No response received even after a follow up email."
"Really weak workouts - a ""whole body"" workout with a total of 4, I repeat, 4 exercises! Almost all of them are that thinly structured. The app is a nice idea but really poorly executed."
Too many bugs for not so cheap app.
"For beginners. You're stuck with a preplanned workout. There is no option to plan your own workout program. Sucks, I paid for a lifetime access, not knowing this crucial point!"
"First of all, my memory is bad, but I thought the introductory plan was a one time payment. However, once a plan is completed it immediately turns into a subscription service $67.93 for the plan and $77.93 was the subscription. I was charged on 12/16, like two weeks away from Christmas and their refund policy specifically targets people like me who tried the app and stopped using it. There are other reviews that talk about some issues but if you are motivated many plans will work for you"
"Absolutely shocking app, why would I have to keep downloading my workout in 2022 and it hardly works when it tries? Recipes are a joke, try and overcomplicate everything. I'd ask for my money back but I think you need it for improvements. Worste app ive ever tried."
"Not bad, not great either. I can't find anything that shows the ability to change available times or days to workout etc. I am only able to workout weekends and Tuesday Thursday but it gave me M W F for days to train. Now I have to manually change each date as we go by moving it over a day. However weekends aren't even an option. Also, I have equipment but it won't let me select WHICH equipment exactly and how much weight available for each. Just seems like the app it good looking but limited."
"Everything on one app, all boring stuff is done for you. Everyone should try it."
This app charge you even after you cancel your subscription. Horrible
Ready to exercise...
Update: the reply from the developer is a lie. The customer services department is an absolute joke. I couldn't get a refund Beware! Very dishonest and unclear! Absolute joke! Give me my money back. Signed up to a plan for 7 days (on the website it specifically said 7 days). A week later they charged me £30 for a month.
"No ability to log weights for your workout. I was looking for an advanced workout plan and this is not it. I requested a refund after 14 days, and it was refused which they said i had to try the program for before i could request one. Do not expect anything from this app"
Good and great thanks for the email though as well I have am lot more ⚅ the world
It's bad app keeps on crashing.
"No way to keep track of improvements. The ""coach"" is limited pre typed questions and answers, a computer really."
"Still alpha level, not worth paying for yet"
very good you MUST try it
Nice layout UI does not provide info like advert says
The promise of a meal plan w a shopping list was great. Unfortunately It just suggests a bunch of extravagant healthy meals that you could never work in to a cooking schedule that involves a family that also needs to eat. The 'shopping list' feature isn't a shopping list at all. It's just a totality of the ingredients in the meals they recommend you eat that day. So unless you are shopping every morning for 1.2 tsp of cinnamon this feature is useless. Can't export workout schedule either.
Cheating and lying just to get you on a subscription 0 stars if possible. Ya you can refund my nearly $80 dollars. There was no mention of recurring subscription I thought it was a onetime purchase. Very misleading and scummy tactic to rob people of their hard earned and LIMITED funds.
"Lots of flaws to the app. I wanted a full gym workout and all I get are home exercises. Plus, the rest and set are often wrong. One instance it said 1 min Rest but the time did 30 seconds. Another was for pulls up, 13 sets of 6 reps but no rest, so basically it was one set of 78 reps. Lastly too many off days. So many other apps out there that are better. I should have only purchased a week plan vs a month. Regretting and can't change my program :("
Ok
The app wasn't where I was physically so it wasn't for me. Didn't make it bad. My issue was after 3 days I requested a refund and but it's taking me 2 weeks later to get a refund issued. By the time that was decided they told me I would.onky get back 50% of what I spent. The app is ok for newbies not great if you have experience.
"You can't adjust your weight goal once you've set it up. The goals tab only allows input of water, kcal, steps, which app doesn't track, and doesn't adjust meals. I'd give the app a higher rating if they allowed in-app adjustment which changed the calorie intake for meal plans. The assistant questions belong in FAQ. Goal tab should have target weight& physique you desire which would adjust everything automatically based on your stats. Everyday it's 3,299 calories even if you want to lose weight."
Found the cancel button
When you start from Zero and you have no idea .. its perfect for you to start up Otherwise it doesnt worth the money It was too few for me
"Great workouts but terrible app... expected more for a paid app, feels like a cheap free app with functionality. WORKOUTS WONT EVEN LOAD SOMETIMES and im stuck doing to the workout from the workout summary page, instead of the tracked workout session... i will not be renewing my subscription unless these issues are fixed. This is a paid app and should at least have basic functionality."
"Thus far, I cannot get the application to load to my CPU desktop via google play. Keeps saying ""Mad Muscles will be installed on your device soon"". Hours later after several attempts.. nothing. Going direct to the website, can't login with my email as I don't have a password yet, nor have been emailed a code to get in. Thus far, the functionality of this sucks."
great
Meh... Too expensive for mediocre app.
not as whats its advertise so slow
"My daughter purchased this for me I don't want it they refuse to refund my money, tried it since I can't get my money back and I can't change some of my info my daughter entered wrong the workouts don't match they equipment I have home or in my gym, the diet it gave me is almost exclusively salmon. Don't waste your money on this app"
"Don't deserve the subscription at all! Meals are Very hard to prepare being outside the us.. Very time based, not suitable for real world gym at all Exercises are not the best..more like a ad. To your products not good app to follow and give you a great shape No one to talk to/ask about something in a Paid app! Except this ROBOT chris with defined things to choose from..even not a regular chat! Def. Dont deserve the sub and Pls i just auto.renewed today i'd like to Refund my sub pls!"
"Free to download, pay to use :/ It doesn't lock specific features, It locks the whole app"
"Horrible! They don't have a proper website to see the subscription and account details. No easy way to manage your accounts. In the advertisement, the subscription was given as 19.99 EURO/month but in the mail the next billing cycle is charging 29.99. Dont go for this app."
Not good at all
Too many difficulties just to enter and get started with the workout routine.
Just paid for a month 2 days ago and now the app won't open for me. I've tried everything and nothing works. Now I have to try and get my money back as I don't know what to do since app won't work.
Scam
Worked for 1 workout then twp days later only load screen... nothing will get it going. Looked promising but now sad I paid for this.
Doesn't give you a chance to test the waters before purchase
Not a fan....written instructions don't match audio or video tutorial. Example. Incline DB bench has audio and video instruction for incline fly. Timer is almost useless...countdown timer to start rest but not end. Also there is no way to track weights used....what good is a program that does not allow you to track your actual progress? Not for anyone who has any experience in the gym. Cancelled after trial month. Meals are not practical either. Giving 1 star
"SCAMMMMM!!! -- App didn't work properly when I downloaded. There's a subscription renewal automatically opted in when you sign up that isn't told to you before you sign up. Then they extort you if you want a refund to help them figure out how to fix their own problem, despite what their refund policy says. Stay far away from this scam and save yourself the time and headache! -- After threatening litigation I was issued a refund. Took 5 days. Good luck with your broken app."
Meals are not simple meals they expect you to spend a ton on meals they don't work with the average person definitely not worth spending money on it
This app does nothing for me I.
Just waist of money .. you are talking to robot and not profesional
"Do not buy! No log history No Rep counting Generally very basic Need to download each individual session The nutrition plan is nearly 42 different meals a week, 6 a day!! There's no vulk prep or simple options either. This was £39.99 for 3 months, I'm writing it off as a tough lesson learned and I'm going back to the free apps which come with log history, graphs, rep counting, weight guidance, simple tutorial for each workout, replacement workout if no kit or injured. Then youtube for meal prep."
Like that it shows you a preview of the exercises but no direction on how much weight and I count my own calories but it would be nice to input my intake of calories. At the moment there's more cons then pros wish I was able to get my money back and use a different app
"Far too expensive and has no free trial. Uninstalling """"""I don't expect it to be free, however how do I know what the apps like without a free trial, or a limited version? In addition, there are a few bad reviews so it's too expensive and risky"""""""
"Good for me, except I can't do any push-up type exercises due to arthritis. I did wall push-ups instead."
"gives great work outs, perfect to my fitness level it seems to increase as plan progresses. It gives you a meal plan and shopping list. O I don't like that you need to let the video of entire exercise play through while you do it, sometimes it stops. When I'm finished and notice it I have to let it play through in order for it to track progress, I did all sets but it didn't track it, I let it run again now streak was reset like I missed workout but tracked minutes increased and no way to fix"
You got me for 16 bucks. I should have known better.
"App is spotty, too many glitches, and workouts don't change much."
"Not impressed AT ALL!! This app does not work if not online, with no provision to log your workout manually after your work out. Their refund policy essentially makes it impossible to get any refund. Not recommended at all."
The app does not allow adjustment of programs nor recording of weights used. Takes too long to load and some supersets are too repetitive
"App subscription scam? Without any reminder before renewal date they will silently charge your bank account , and even if you contact them immediately they will refuse the refund. Looking at their replies to other people reporting this issue, it seems it's not an isolated incident!Google, if you are reading this - check other reviews, lots of people in this situation!"
I expect something really helpful. That's not helpful.
Scammer app and bad customer service. I clicked on another app promising 30 day workout schedule only to be put on a subscription plan on this app for a 60 day minimum workout plan and can't be refunded. I wouldn't go with any misleading app like this one. I literally wrote to them the same day and I didn't even bother to open their plan. What goods comes from misleading advertising and refusing to listen to the customer. I would advise ppl who got scam to report their illegal practices.
Doesn't tell you what weight to use before starting workout. Cannot adjust meal plan timings. Warm up is so fast. Should slow down the video before starting next warm up.
When I tried to sign up for email and I typed in the code it kept on saying the code was incorrect even though it was actually the correct code that was sent to my email at the same time.
Excellent app thankyou
Why can't I see any reviews here!!??
The overall fitness program was helpful though repetitive. The app does not track progress beyond weightloss and total number of work outs. What made this a 1 star for me and not a 2 star was customer service. According to the terms and service the subscription renews automatically as well as increases the price significantly if you do not cancel 24 hours before the renewal date. The day I was charged I requested a canceling and refund but after a several days delay was denied.
"Stay away from paying this company. I had their subscription for 3 days, didn't like the application because there were several features that were very inconvenient, so I requested a refund. I was denied, then they vaguely alluded to their mentally deficient refund policy. Hey, buddies. I shouldn't have to follow your workout plan for 14 days to say I dislike your application, not the exercises. This is a logical defect in your mind that probably haunts you on a daily basis. This is a scam."
"Update: this is disgusting! I cancelled a day before the renewal and they still charged me because it's ""not 24hrs"". I want my fcuking money back you corrupted a..holes!!! Isigned up on the 16th October, cancelled it yesterday, which was the 15th November, but got charged and the email support don't want to give back my money! Give me back my £30!!!!!!!"
"Muy costosa, y no me gustan los tipos de ejercicios."
My MEAL plan never (NEVER!!!) updates monthly. I always have to do without it. It would be nice to have a program but stayed up-to-date. But this problem would be resolved you would get 5 out of 5 stars. Trying to better myself in my body and I cannot depend on this app. Do better !!!
Made the mistake of buying the premium version when i saw a money back garuntee. Turns out that it doesnt apply if you just dont like how disfunctional the app is. Try it out by all means just dont get the premium unless you like the flow of the app.
The app does work but not when you click start workout It shows black screen and cannot log my workout This is pretty expensive to not work Let me know how to fix it and how to get my money back (Signed up 3 days ago)
"Lame. Not upfront about costs. Nothing wrong about changing for what you have created, but do this before you gather a bunch of information from users."
"Not the greatest app out there. Beware, do not purchase directly from their website. The refund policy is basically non existent even though they offer a guarantee. I was not happy with the app as the workout plans are either not enough or too difficult as far as equipment is concerned. The interface is a nightmare to use during workouts. It just felt very lacking for a paid app. User beware."
Don't pay for this if you ever want to cancel your subscription. It's nearly impossible and there is barely any customer support for this issue.
Had to pay for everything and anything :/
"The workouts on the 1st day were good. After that, it kept adding in exercises that I said no to during the questionnaire to get started, due to injury and availability of equipment. There is no option to switch the exercise or go back and remove them"
"I needed a app for workout, so I found this app and saw the reviews and paid for the app around $40usd, well this app is designed by someone who never seen a gym, I went to the gym and opened the app and realized this app is total trash,Reasons, 1 it will show you exercise videos which you can skip, 2. If you want to swap the exercise, will good luck it changes the whole workout, 3. You can't skip certain exercises, &no refund even after 24hrs$, most of the reviews are fake"
Can't do simple things. Can't add a simple run. When I go to ask a questions it won't allow me to actually ask a question it leads me on whatever path it wants to take me.
Way too expensive
To easy
"Definitely does not meet the expectations of a paid app. Not very user-friendly and it kinda tends to be an advertisement for its other products before anything else. Not intuitive, not easy to navigate, not really a lot of bells and whistles. It's really not even as good as Samsung Health app that came with my phone. There is a lot of potential here, but it's not there yet."
this mad muscle program is it.I thought it wasn't about nothing.It prove me wrong. Good work guys!
Very satisfied
"A normal app. As a beginner i dont know how mutch i need to lift or how many reps i need to do. In exercise time just go, no sound information when swich sides.. good app, but not worth the money that i paid :/"
Had to cancel because of an injruy and they were very good about sorting it out
A SCAM APP! I PAIED AND DIDNT GET ACCSES TO THE APP AND I TRIED CONTACT THEM BUT NO RESPONS! DO NOT PAY!
Good for a very fundamental workout plan. Doesn't meet my expectations of a paid app. (Ex. Problems implementing unilateral workouts into an existing plan because it lists 'left' and 'right' as separate exercises which can't be ordered back to back.) The final straw for me was when it had me in superman 'until the alarm signals' me to stop. It never signaled. I collapsed and looked to find it was halfway into the next rest period. I've used better no subscription apps.
"SCAM SCAM SCAM!!! 1st update- I have reached out to support, so far they have only responded to this review. / Don't fall for it, as I did. Should have done my research or read the reviews first. Trying to get my $ back and cancel any other payments. Will hopefully be able to update you if they don't block me."
Terrible plan. Cannot change option to add a 5-6 day plan. Each session contains 2-3 compounds and then maybe 1 or 2 accessory exercise thats it. Better off using youtube and taking sometime learning about different types of training yourself then going from there. Don't waste you money!
NOT free at all. Everything is locked.
Workouts not varied much and repetitive. No Workouts geared toward gym our at home and not toward having gym equipment at home. Meal plan is expensive and very time consuming.
DO NOT USE THIS APP! THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU. This app sucks and there are better free or cheaper workout apps.
Asked for pay information twice. And the second request was at a higher rate.
Day two.. it's a very good app in its entirety but you cannot make edits or changes to baseline metrics once submitted so have your information correct because you will be building a plan based on those numbers.
"Great app, love the workouts and meal recipes. One suggestion for improvement would be to add a 3-5 second window between exercises to allow you to get in the new position for the next exercise."
"Getting loads of notifications to drink water and Track my water intake, but can't for the life of me find anywhere in the app to log when I drink water. So how's that going to work?"
"Seriously mixed feelings on this app (hence the 3 star review). The workouts themselves are good and the videos generally helpful. BUT the app doesn't actually let me record what I did (eg weight used, difficulty of run, etc) and seems to get confused about whether I even did a given workout or not (eg not marking it complete after saying ""congrats""). It's all timer based, which isn't very realistic in a modern gym so I end up having to pause it frequently, which seems counterproductive."
Super hard to get a hold of customer service agent. I just wanted to cancel as i found a better option.
Sorry cancel me the pay. I never used the app
Very expansive app. Warmup and cool down are generic and very unprofessional and don't rely on actual workout. Sometimes a workout is unbelievably hard. Not recommended.
Great app
"-- So many limitations!!! For example, you can only use a tablet. You must also download the workout. You can't pause, rewind, etc. -- Faulty programming!!! I spent ample time providing my desired food options only to receive a meal plan that had 30+ other food items. -- Atrocious refund policy!!! You have to follow the plan for 14 full days to get a refund. And even then it's heavily scrutinized and probably impossible to obtain. (READ IT BEFORE BUYING!!!) -- Not recommended by me!!!"
They actually don't offer anything for free until you pay for it so its a big let down since I was really looking forward for it...so disappointed
I emailed to ask how to adjust my personal information such as my initial weight I entered is completely wrong...it's off my 285 lbs...so the app doesn't have a way to edit personal information? I still have received no email to my question on how to fix my weight entry
"Tried this on a whim. actually pretty lit. huge value from the meal planner and the workout side of the app is great. only compliant is sometimes the audio ques don't play but it could be my device being funny. seriously recommend, well worth the price."
Scam tried to bill me twice
"Application has potential, BUT: What needs work: -you can't rewind videos, be it progress bar or tap left/right for 5sec increments like youtube, you need to watch the whole exercise video again; -some exercises RUSH YOU through warm up and cooldown, like whoever programmed these workouts got bored of hearing the same explanations over and over abd summed it up to ""do this, do that etc, etc MOVING ON"". -no pause between exercises so that users can move from weights to rubberband/chair/floor;etc"
"It has great initial test to lead you to subscribe. but that's all! After that is soooo dissaponting. I will tell you why: - after subscribe, i've been get into to a training program with some positions that does not explain clear enough: They dont have information about which muscle area this position for, how much weigh to lift, how long break between reps is.... Nothing, You have to swim in the ocean. - no refund (refund is very strict, equally none), event you have just subs. for 5minute."
Deceptive marketing I will not do business with this company. I cancelled my PayPal payment. They do not have a way to unsubscribe. Instead they tell you to download their app. Do NOT USE! This is spam!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!????!!!!
This by far one the biggest scams ever. Its shocking.
"Clumsy interface, can't control workout flow, can't identify specific equipment available. A dime a dozen in apps for fitness that done have anything special to offer over others."
Cannot change your plan once u select a plan ur stuck with it
"Aweful don't bother, also puts you on to an automatic renewal with very little warning."
"Not very effective, as less options for exercise lacks type, time , frequency and very less options if you are vegetarian"
Not easy to workout with. There is no time between one to next activity for someone to change position. The weight and workout tracking is confusing and clunky to use. Uninstalling and canceling membership.
"App seems easy to use so far. And I can see the usefulness. But...I can't adjust exercises to allow for injuries. In the set up it glossed past things to be aware of, but didn't give me a chance to select anything. I am currently rehabilitating a lower back injury, so would like to avoid barbell squats/lunges/deadlifts, etc, for the time being. You can tailor other things in options, why not this important area? Especially after someone has paid for the use."
Couldn't find anywhere on your app to give you feedback but the static boat after huffing and puffing makes it very difficult to breath. A plank should work fine and allow the person to breath properly.
It's bad
"The app keep showing ""gosh, what is going on😱😱 bla bla ... "" After entering my weight and other info.😱"
"One of the worst apps I've used, don't buy it. Didn't narrate the workout so you had to keep your eyes on the video to see what to do. Also, parts of it were narrated but in French, which unfortunately I am not fluent in. Worst money spent on a fitness app."
Not really happy with it. You have to watch your tiny phone screen. There is very little voice over. It doesn't inform you when the break is over and when the next workput starts or ends so you have to constantly check your phone. Really basic stuff that shouldnt be an issue. Also I can't find anywhere to update my workout plan. For example I didn't have equipment and now I do... Don't see where I can update that. Honestly I'll probably ask for a refund and find something else.
I accidentally payed for a subscription and i want to refund could you please let me know how to as soon as possible. Thank you
"BUYER BEWARE! This app does not give you personal workout, does not refund even though during signup they say they will."
Totally useless. Gave me an exercise program that there was no chance I could do. Diet guide is a joke.
"Bad recomandations. App recommends exercises that I previously stated that I can not do. When you try to swap, it gives recommandations for completly different set of muscles. It does not take into account the strength level you tell it in the beginning. Also no refund, after maximum 2 minutes of using."
"Very dissapointing / False advertising. It says you recieve a catered plan to you, its not, its generic. You cant log anything in there, I litrarly started yesterday and I am super dissapoint, I signed up to the 3 months, I would lime a refund as nothing is catered to me. Even when I change my goals on the app how can the workout still be the same??? This is boarder line robbery, not happy at all"
It's a scam
"No bugs yet, I like the ramp in period idea. The app is NOT annoying like duo, the work outs are easy to follow. And I would not be embarrassed to use in public.. so overall a great way to learn technique, and helps you keep on top of things. HOWEVER! The meal plans are slightly unrealistic, I need a weekly shopping list. I do not want to nor do I have the time to go to the store every single day."
"This is a mistake. I haven't read the reviews before I paid for 3 months for this app. Please dont repeat my mistake. Don't waste money on this app. The app is not developed properly. As a guy who works out regularly, the exercise programs are interesting BUT the way how the application it self is built, it's bad. You cannot ask for a refund just because you don't like the app. That is a scam. To the developer, please try to visit other work out apps maybe you will be able to learn."
It is a scam
Great
"Revised review, all issues have been resolved. The app is a great tool to have if you're interested in getting in shape. It had a glitch at first but it was fixed within 24 hours. The workouts are unique and have a good mix of exercises that make it interesting and fun. I do have a problem with billing. I'm unable to cancel my subscription on the Google app store. I need to have this resolved before the auto renewal kicks in. Also my bank charges a international transaction fee with each charge"
Useless
I just wrongly input my initial weight and would like to amend it but it is not allow to do it. Try to contact the support twice and still no reply. I subscribed it for only one night and want to refund!!!!!!!
"it's actually really good. It reminds you to drink water, it has great meal suggestions, the exercises are reasonable, the warm ups are something you can do throughout the day. I'm usually a bit of a sceptic with this sort of thing; but so far, so good."
Would rate higher but the meal plan no matter the connection I have always says not connected and will no do meal plan or prep or the grocery list.
Update: The app developers asked me to log another support ticket. They responded very quickly to my review. Customer Support is adamant - no refund because there is no policy for it. I subscribed to Mad Muscle and on the same day changed my mind. I requested a refund and I did not use the app at all after the first download. Customer support took a while and eventually let me know that they will not refund me because changing your mind is not covered in the returns policy. So I lost $25 !
"Their ""MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE"" is a trap, they flaunt it in front of you like it's legit until they get you to purchase. In their policies you'll find out how NOT guaranteed it is."
I couldn't get my money back after canceling my subscription. I contacted support sooo many times and they only made excuses like *that is not in our refund policy* when I didn't do anything against it. I feel like I got scammed :(
"Good app, I believe the breathing is backwards but it is good reliability and good amount of reminders for water, food and exercises."
"All of my progress has disappeared ater nearly 2 months. Support says that can't bring it back if you ""miss a day"" and that's understandable. But they don't have a resolve for all of my data disappearing. I have put in 5days +2rests since signing up. Now I'm starting on week one, day one of my routine. Last week I was doing supersets and now I'm doing sets of 12 push-ups 😔 I'm leaving this one star review and hopes that support resolves the issue so that I can give them five stars. 🤞"
Workouts are okay. The app sucks.
Problem resolved after rating posted.
No trial - no party
My only problem is that I can't see my meal plan other than that I love this app
Scammmmmmmmmm
"App is OK, not great, but NB: they will do unathorised debits on your card. It is basically a scam - they offer one month for a small amount, with no obligations to continue. Later, they up the amount although it was clearly indicated it was once off trial fee."
"Sometimes I'll finish a workout and it won't log it, leaving it unchecked, and therefore muddling my workout history."
I love thos app but I suggest being able to change your diet and a better assistant so u can have more help when needed
Unable to rewind or fast forward workouts & if you touch the screen or get a call it starts over & you can't do anything about it. Meal plans are bizarre & have ZERO to do w/ all the info I gave them. ALSO... TONS OF FAKE 'REVIEWS'. Cancelling & uninstalling.
Good app. It's nice to work outs
"This app is garbage, designed for a specific demographic (Not for the West). JetFit is a hopeless app that understands it audiences. Don't waste your time here."
"Worst app ever, no trial period, and you can't get at refund, please don't try this"
The layout of the workouts are bad. There are no plan to put everything together for a complete traing program
"Features lacking but decent fitness programming. *should be able to toggle between apps without workout pausing (hop over to Spotify to switch music, then must unpause workout. no good) *should be able to run workouts without video (battery / screen usage nonsensical) *needs option to choose small / or no video during workout *audio cues at start of movement and at the end required."
My back pain went away pretty much after the first session. (I'm a slob whose only exercise in the past five years has been lifting a beer to my mouth).
App is terrible. Waist of money nothing else. Don't invest money rather go to gym or eat bunyof food at home
If there is one thing that is robbery in the software industries is to start an unknown app by purchasing it without knowing weather or not it will cater for your needs or just simple meet your expectations there are no refunds therefore I believe we are untitled to a trial run to actually see the contents of what we are about to pay for so for me it's a no no.
"Got asked how many pullups I can do. 5, Ok great, do 15 reps and 3 sets of them. Also they talk about getting burned out because of going to hard, After the 1st days workout my shoulders hurt so much that I can't move my arms. I need a way of reporting the hurt spots so the workout can be changed to not include the hurt muscle until its healed. The dieet is also expensive, you would have to buy groceries every day and prep 3 hours of food for 1 work day. Just tell me to eat a fruit or veg jeez."
App doesn't work and won't met me sign up
Great just 👍
I like trying things out first before taking the plung. A week's free trial wouldn't have been a bad idea. Couldn't try it out!! #GiveAWeekFreeTrial or allow for a week's subscription for trials.
Can't cancel subscription
Not good at all don't wast your time. Better off paying for a gym membership and asking the new guy for help.
"I like the app, but it drives me crazy that the slightest interruption: changing the song, phone ring, etc and the workout has to start over. Which means, if I don't start over or just let it run all over again...I don't get credit. 🤦🏿‍♂️"
Awful the app commits u to a plan that he sees right and doesn't give u thr chance to customize it and the didn't gimme a refund for bieng so horrible
"Good structure of the trainings and easy to follow. Unfortunately very limited in basic options and 30 day money back warranty is not so. I started the training with 3 days per week, and decided to go for 5 days a week. It is not possible. You have to stay with original plan."
"So far it's OK. only on day 5. Easy to use. Wish it had manual entry options, to record data, weight choices etc."
"This exercise app is different. I know because I've tried other fitness apps but none compares to MadMuscles. I love that I can set my level and the exercises match my capabilities. I've seen the result; slow, steady, progressive. For a no equipment workout it is absolutely amazing. I'll keep it running for a while..."
very helpful
Scamy app
"The workouts are very robotic and not personal at all. There are better, more engaging apps out there, I suggest you shop around."
SCAM! They will keep billing your credit card.
Why have u asked for preferences for food but not integrated in meal plans
Best app so far! Having a good time
"This is scam! I bougjt one month! Again one month for 19,99 and now they charge me after one month 29.99??? What is this??"
"Way to many notifications, I've turned them off in the app but still getting harrassed. I can't input my own workouts or activity. Once you've selected their workout plan you have to do it. Might be good for beginners but not me"
"I can't this app, you have to pay direct before you start"
"If it's a paid app, why wouldn't tell me that from the beginning, not until I have filled all my personal information!"
"Pretty good. Food options and workout swaps are good features. Wish you could monitor daily water intake, though."
I have a problem getting in the app
I like this app esy to use
Customer service was good. A few bugs in the android version. The only thing missing is the ability to record weights used. Apart from that the app is good to use.
"Charged again after the initial period I thought I unsubscribed, so disappointed the app didn't appeal to me so I didn't even actually use it properly."
Scam.... I dont see when I state that you can withdraw money from one account without notifying them... it a disgrace to me to put my financial trust in this app... So I just deleted my account...
this program really helped me get into shape
Wow!! I am someone who needs to be told and showed what to do when it comes to working out. MadMuscles delivers exactly that and more while including a meal plan and the associated shopping list. I just wish that the shopping list be also available in a weekly format instead of the dayly list provided.
"Nothing special that my other free app cant do. Waste of money, plus once u're subscribe, they wont refund, if the app simply dosnt meet our expectation. Recipes are just not even worth mentionning. Wouldnt recommend, ill stick to youtube and free apps."
it's not as expected and not helpful
Just not impressed with a full gym workout of jump ropes and burpees.
Love the workout instructions and meal plan! Lots of options and clear instructions. Only issue is that I went shopping for groceries for an entire week and then changed meal times and it completely changed my meals for the week! I was able to get most back from memory luckily but be aware of this.

The are much better options.
Not worth the money. You can get everything this offers elsewhere for free. You not getting a trainer they will even offer you a extra supposedly 24/7 assistance chat but it's just a automated chat bot and do they do not respond to emails if you want a workout plan this app for you the rest of the features is just upselling
Great APP And I Can Lost My weight Over 10 kg.
It's takes your money and then it tries to recharge you again when it signs you in. You don't get any help and if your not careful they will double charge you!
I tried a lot of apps... This one is the best.
"Would be 5 stars if it logged the weight I did on each exercise and told me the next time I go to do the exercise. All the stretches make you look like a cheap hooker so I use an app called STRETCHING EXERCISES before and after workouts, for runs, stretching muscles, relaxing days. They even have stretches for random things"
Won't open
"I thought that would have a trial, as the account creating lead you to think, but was charged right away. Do not recommend the app. Update: Despite the message added to my comment looking like the company is concerned, I was only fooled with messages saying I would get a refund within 5 days. A month has passed and the refund has never been made. Stay away from this app, don't even install it, it's a scam. They are only interested in your money."
Your app sucks it won't even send a basic email so I can enter the damn code. Fix your junk or give me my money back.
"Unless you are a total beginner with literally zero knowledge of anything related to exercise or diet, this app is total rubbish. You can get better routines, diet advice, etc from Reddit & YouTube. The personalised workouts are hilariously unpersonalised. Swapping out exercises can 100% change your routine/muscle groups being hit - because there is literally zero effort put into the app's ability to customise the routines it serves up on the fly. Lastly, the refund policy is a total joke."
"Remove the ukraine flag. What are you, stupid? How many BILLIONS of dollars have to be printed before you idiots realize your KIDS future is being squandered on a loser country that never contributed anything to the world?? Cucks."
Can't cancel subscription
Where's my refund!? I requested a refund after the second day because your food options were disgusting. Your T's & C's clearly state money back if unhappy with results. So where's the money??!!
"Absolute rubbish. Signed up for the weekly plan £6.99 cancel anytime, in the small print, they take a week then they move you onto to monthly. I used the app twice. Its not very good at all, then before I know it £30 is taken IN ADDITION to my 6.99. the team there had no sympathy despite me not using the app after first two days. Thats £37 wasted. DO NOT MAKE the same mistake I did. Cowboys."
"Rubbish app. Very buggy. Concept is good but poor execution. Used it for maybe a week. Was not reminded that I would be charged again for a renewal, long after I stopped using the app. Reached out to support, who as per website say they respond in an hour. That was a couple of days ago. I hope many people read this and don't similarly fall for your scam. You really should remind people that you are about to take cash, especially if they don't use the app. Updt: Company refuses to refund 26/08"
I pay to the wrong app
"Fraud, spam, don't install. They put me on auto renewal without I knew about it, i couldn't cancel the subscription for couple of months, and the refuse to refund my money."
It's great but more room for improvement.
Good basic app but just like any fitness or health routine it takes effort. the app has lots of room for improvement but it's simplicity makes the journey not so complicated.
It's a scam app because they get money from subscription and if you don't cancel they keep getting money from your account without any pre notice. Late response from customer support and no way to get money back. Disappointed!
"Definitely not recommending. The overall user interface is good but, the return policy is very strict. You have to follow the work plan through the app for at least 15 day to ask for refund. And it doesn't matter if you doesn't like to app or even don't be able to workout anymore."
"Very poor app with the worst support from customer care. Emma, the support person just streched a small query for more than 30 days without a complete resolution. Inspite of regular follow-ups, they just send a automated response repeatedly and ignore the quality of the request and response for the customer's congeniality."
"Terrible app. No science, no customization, no support."
Not what I had expected. No help button within app but it says 24/7 chat unless I'm mistaken. Not the layout I had expected. Less than 24hrs and opting out pls refund n stop subscription
it is a scam
"The videos have no ability to rewind or fast forward, you can only start over or skip to next video. The workouts themselves are like 20 seconds long before switching to another workout. I don't even have time to do it properly before its saying to switch. I am so confused, waste of money."
"Regret paying the price! There is no trial option and the apps doesn't allow you to withdraw your payment! It doesn't even show you an info of what it's going to sell! I don't recommend it at all!!!! They only provide a refund option if you have worked out for 14 consecutive days, which didn't happen in my case because I was sick and I couldn't workout once! Which is against the 14day withdraw law for EU!"
"AVOID! DO NOT SUBCRIBE!! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!! If i could give this app 0 stars I would. I downloaded the app and paid for subscription. After doing that I checked out the workouts and meal plan, I didn't like any of the 2. I immediately contacted the support team requesting a refund. One of the personnel got back to me asking me to state what I don't like and they will make changes to the app. I said I don't want any changes I want my money back.This is over a week and no one replied to my email."
Can't save the work out or meal plan you paid for. Obviously money oriented and not people oriented.
Payable😭
Paid for the service can't even get the app to load. I've un-installed and re-installed multiple times
"Can't change personal details, meal plan never worked, work outs are on a limited rotating schedule"
"Although individual exercises are well demonstrated, workouts fail to feel personalized or engaging and don't seem to take advantage of full racks or weights. Meal plan is repetitive, and ingredients are often unobtainable or meals are outright foul. Most frustratingly, this app constantly reminds you to do things that the app doesn't seem capable of doing, like track your water intake. Meal reminders occur hours after they should (breakfast at 1030, lunch reminders at 1500)."
"It's a scam, they took the renewal fees from my card Also, the program is nit custom and did suits me since day one, send a lot of emails with no revent support It's unuseful app and bad experience"
When I was forced to pay a 2nd time to subscribe I decided to uninstall the app. I thought if I pay 35 USD I get my plan. But then came the second payment...
"THE BEST APP EVER! I'm a professional athlete, and I know what I'm saying. Mainly this app helps when you can't visit the gym regularly because of work trips or traveling, so the personal program in Mad Muscles saves."
It's really fantastic that the app offers the training program for all problematic areas I have. It allows me to concentrate on the most painful areas for my appearance and fix them without any difficulties!
"I was thinking maybe 3 or 4 weeks before downloading the app. I thought it didn't make sense because there are a lot of videos on the Internet. Just watch and do! But, considering that I'm not a super disciplined person, it was hard to make myself do some training every day. So the critical moment was a break in 1 month. I was lazy like a bone. Then I stopped and said, you need to try that app, just for one week, and then you'll see if it's OK or not. Well, it's more than OK! Now I just follow all the instr"
"The App won't even load. Took my money, but does not work."
so far I enjoy it but I keep geting notifications telling me to track my water intake but I cannot figure out how to do that with your app csn you please help
Have a very hard time trying to figure out how to do anything. There is no way to contact anyone other than message where have to wait 1 or 2 days for reply.
Scam
Nice workout 💪
APP is trash like why we have to pay?there is so many other workout apps that are free.the only reason i downloaded this is because it looked good in the instagram ads
"It isn't bad... but it has a lot of things that could make it better. swapping out exercises would be better if they gave suggestions based on what you are taking out. Also, it would be better if it gave you weight suggestions based on you doing some sort of ""max"". Doing an equipment inventory when setting up would make it more likely to suggest good exercises and weights. I won't be renewing unless I'm just too early in the app and it gets better."
Worst fitness app ever.never ever install this app😤😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I've been with the app for 6 months. I'm satisfied with the result I see every day in the mirror :)..
Single most disappointing app purchase I've ever had. Baits you with 15 minutes worth of questions so that you think it's going to be thorough and well calculated. I was looking for a workout program at the gym. This keeps giving me workouts to do with 6L bottles of water as weights and bodyweight exercises even though I specifically said I want to use equipment at the gym. This isn't showing up in my play store subscriptions. How tf do I cancel?
Cool and easy-to-understand app with cool and modern design!
"I really wanted this app to be the one, but too buggy. The concept is great - all in one fitness, nutrition, water reminders. But can't get past the fact that workouts sometimes reset, progress gets deleted if you ""update"" your goals, and the workouts seem to be the same regardless of the goal you choose. Unfortunately still needs some work before it's a good product and worth the money."
I thought I would be getting a long term calendar based off the advertisement but it only provided a week.
I didn’t have enough memory on my smartphone to install this app. So I deleted some games to download Mad Muscles. No more time waiting to achieve your dream body!!!!!! I'm proud of myself.
"The best sports app I've ever tried. I installed it accidentally while waiting in the airport queue. Well, my vacation was active! And thanks to a personal program, I could keep fit during all my rest at the beach."
The devops are cool! I hope they'll expand their programs for women also!!
"My elder sis advised me of this app. She was preparing for the bodybuilder's contest. Billy hasn't taken any place because of some circumstances, but the jury was amazed at how she looked!"
STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!! CUSTOMER SERVICE NON EXISTENT. Wanted a refund after the first day as the plan wasn't for me. Emailed customer service twice but had no answer after 10 days. DISGUSTING
Waste app .... ..
No many
My body becomes a machine after every workout with MM )))
Pathetic
"downloading each exercise for a small useless video is annoying. Each exercise doesn't tell you which weights to use. Only says use appropriate weight, and what is that. How do I match the correct weight for each one. This is supposed to be a personalised workout app. The reps seem weird randomised with no real plan. In a few I felt I could do more and others seem to kill me. Maybe since I wasn't using the correct weight, which is the first problem. Not enough characters to share all problems"
Special thanks for the excellent meal planner! Now all in one app!!
Helpful app. Who hasn't tried yet - take a look. Very effective training plans.
Not easy to use this app 💩
Bad aap.... 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
👎👎👎👎
It's good
Tooo bad 😴👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Vocus app
Froud app
Mujhe Temple gift karo 5 kilo wala
"Bought cuz it included meal plans and discovered there's no way to edit the ingredients list after you first set it up, so I'm stuck with insane 61-ingredient meal plans per day and wow that's not useful."
"Not effective as aspected, waste of money waste of time"
$50 for incessant notifications and no tracking or modifications to your workout
Cool to finally have a balanced workout plan. I feel much healthier and less exhausted with recovery days.
My payment has been rejected twice and thank God after reading the reviews. Saved!
"Silly, disingenuous program. Don't tell me that there's a ""no equipment"" program and then have several exercises that use 6 litre water bottles and dumbbells. You can swap exercises, but the reason I bought the program *was* the no equipment option. Also, the meal plans are a nice concept, but ridiculously implemented. 4 meals a day, but with no thought to sourcing ingredients beforehand. I can't magically make mango and quail egg salad on my first day of the program. $39/mo is a joke."
I do really appreciate that your app considers my physical traits and goals. Working in the right tempo is the half of the win!
"The app needs work, I paid for the month and immediately was turned off by the lack of tracking. I want to be able log water intake, meals and workouts to keep track and adjust throughout the day. I like the layout and reminders, the workout videos are well explained, it has a lot of potential but again without being able to log anything to the reminder you can't really keep track of your progress. Currently this is not for me unfortunately, maybe later down the line."
Didn't use the app and stolr 35 quid from me. Do not waste your time
"Tried the app for a month, didn't like it. Never subscribed for a second month, my credit card was charged for a second month. I had to block them via my credit card account. They just take money from your credit even after cancelling your subscription."
Opick haju Auntie talking Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre
Don't waste your money this app is just not worth it yet has a long way to go to be good and worth the money to get a program.
You asked to rate here j am
Constant reminders to track your water and calorie intake and no way to actually do it.
Charged for 3 months and never got a plan no response from supoort cheating app
"They show a 30-day money-back guarantee when you make the purchase, but after that the refund policy has conditions that basically makes it impossible to get a refund."
"asked em to pay, uninstalled"
Workout take forever to download and end with blank black screen
One of the worst experiences with customer service ever. They do not provide any easy way to unsubscribe. There is nothing in the app itself and there is no browser login version to controll your subscription. When they charged me 30 euros I told them I dont want to the app and to cancel the transaction(I did not use the app this month) since it was not approved by a bank yet. They waited so it would get approved and only then told me they cannot return money. Now they just stopped answering.
"Weird colours in the icon...I do not want to support anything woke these days. I pay for the service, not for the cause of the day. And I do not belive the Ukraine is defending freedom and democracy. Only ignorant people may want to shove their beliefes down other people throats."
So far so good except it keeps saying when I go to the meal plan to check my phones connection when I have full bars on my home wifi and when I use my own mobile data so I don't understand beyond that point
"Please stop looping the excerise videos, why can I record the weights used per set. I want my money back!!"
"When asking to cancel the subscription the agent offered to extend my subscription which was very condescending. After my subscription was cancelled and I asked for a refund I was given excuses that were used to trump sound logic. This is a fraud app, roping you in with services they can't deliver and they won't return your money. Pay attention to other reviewers who say the app doesn't work. It really doesn't. It should be removed from the Play Store. It's a one sided cash generator."
Pretty good overall but recently I've been experiencing a bug where it won't show the video for the exercise at all and the voice that tells you what to do next doesnt speak either( and yes I made sure it was turned on). Fix this please?
How do I renew my subscription forever? ahah Love this app! <З!!
"Doesnt account for 3rd shift/other schedules. Explainations are too short for beginners. Requires quick equipment/weight shifting with no time in between. No transition time to prepare for the next exercise at all - you rush to catch up. Meal plan does not offer options for medical restrictions. Shopping lists are by day and amount used instead of by week and by buyable amount (Half a banana one day, 0.3 two days. 2/week makes sense.) This does help you lose weight and gain muscle if can keep up"
"Terrible app, didn't even get to test to see if it was good as they want money straight away. Fastest app I've ever uninstalled, Avoid."
I like the app a lot! The only thing that really really bothers me is the auto rotate that does not respect androids options not to do it. It's also really sensitive and sometimes breaks. Definitely recommend removing this asap.
There is no complaint but there could be better features. One I would like is a weekly shopping list. The daily one works fine but inconvenient having to move back and forth.
"Generic , don't waste my time"
"Tha app is very useful and keeps you busy with plenty of exercises. The meal plan is also a good way to make sure you're getting the proper nutrients to fuel your body. If you use supplements on top of the workout plan you will see results in 1-2 weeks and after a month of solid commitment you will be happy with the results. Stay hydrated, fuel your body, get mad muscles!"
Good app for exercise
"My muscles are like rocks now!! How do you do it, MM?!"
Reasonable price for excellent quality. I lost 20 pounds with MadMuscles - I’m going to start a full subscription!
"Love your HIITs workouts :) My body is hardy now. So, I can safely go on a hike, as I have long dreamed of."
Poor
To build mascle
The app is not working for me. When I want to work my biceps It's giving me all sort of excercises except for arms.
It's a very good app which helps me to train
"I pad and the app doesn't work, it says i didn't pay. Don't buy this"
Just starting out and there is no way to communicate back to the trainer or cpu. I can't tell them what I need or what I've been through to get a program that fits me.
Very good
Meal plan doesn't even work. I want a refund
"Helps motivate and gives work out. Some problems like the cool down clip cuts off halfway through it, and doesn't have many abs targeted work outs, and have yet to see any of the meal plan and $1 add ons. Pretty good, a little shady."
Get much more out of free apps. There is no tailored progression no rhyme nor reason to workouts. It's executed badly meal plans are just a basic list of foods. Had me scheduled to do squats 3 days in a row. Tried to change workout as far to easy. I regularly do 20kg curls this wanted me using 6kg water bottles I tried to adjust it said I wasn't ready. Might be good for someone who has never exercised before but not worth any money
VERY basic app. Nothing is personalised and it's very limited. £39.99 for 3 months is a complete rip off at this stage. You cannot monitor your reps or keep track of workouts because it won't let you add or track them. And some of the figures just seem random. Save your cash and get a PT or buy a subscription to an actual coaches page. I'll be requesting a full refund once the 2 week trial period is up.
Horrible app I would highly recommend sending this app straight to hell
"The app doesn't need major fixes but these are some improvements I want to see: 1. On my phone, even though rotation is off, even moving the phone slightly switches orientation. It gets very annoying when I move my phone a tad bit and it switches portrait to landscape for 5 seconds. 2. There are some exercises I CANT DO. I should have the ability to select build ups instead of going hardcore. 3. Nutrition isn't editable. Need options for low calorie diets, kosher mode, etc."
1. Unflexible workout program that fit your condition 2. Inaccurate workout information 3. Confuse Nutritient Material 4. Defensive customer support. 5. Intransparent refund policy Pissed off with the back and forth with customer support.. decided to get another diet and fitness app... HealthifyMe is far more established and helpful
"Thanks for the Team work, who gide me on the correct information and tacnice ."
it's great so far but they should give you the option to account for allergies with the food.
Meal plan does not generate keeps asking to log weight even if weight has been logged.
Super intuitive and fast. I was hooked immediately. Signed and am ready to roll. I have a picture of the body I am working towards. It would be cool to have the image in my app as inspiration.
"Not what I expected has water intake I con but doesn't keep track. Same with calories intake. Work outs are OK, but hard to view for beginners. I would like a refund."
Prix
Money scammers!!! Terrible app! Zero results !! Just Charges money from you!
Really helpful app. I find the workouts are great and the meal plans keep me from going off and eating whatever I want. it takes the work out of thinking and planning what I am going to do.
A significantly worse version of Jefit for way more money
"I was charged and I didnt receive the email confirmation , is it scam ?"
"Very boring. No music, no trainer enthusiasm etc. ...and no actual trainer. Just video of someone doing the workouts so u can see the technique but there's no interaction. I always thought T25 etc were over the top sometimes, but now I see what the opposite looks like. Best description: Imagine and exercise book with techniques, plans, pictures of the workouts...became an app where instead of written words you have voice and instead of pictures you have video. Nothing more nothing less."
It's a f****** piece of s***
perfect and thanks for your help
"Feeling the exercises, great system. Have to stay focused to see results."
"It seems like it's pretty comprehensive for people who already know what they are doing, but for the rest of us it's pretty worthless. It suffers from the same issue all other workout plans suffer from. Not enough guidance. The exercises suggested to me included dumbbells, but without any indication of what the weight should be."
I been working out for a year now 6 days a week 3 hrs a day and i hit a wall with the knowlegde and diet in 2 weeks i feel stronger than ever getting results already
Rubbish
It doesnt refresh my nutrition plan dosnt work at all
"I rarely take my time to write a review, but these guys deserve it. Customer service is exceptional and not only is the customer service great, but the app is amazing. It's motivating to use and I already see improvements. Their meal plan is seriously amazing and having a go-to app that tracks your meals and helps you throughout workouts is seriously wow. Why haven't I found this app before?"
very good program for committed members
Does anyone know how to get the in workout music player to work
"Really not happy so far. Shopping list didn't match to the actual meal requirements. If you change between Home and Gym, it's like everything resets. Need to be able to change to deal with travel situations. Workouts are not tuned at all, I'm not sure what the point of the initial fitness test is. And you'll be asked to redo that test everytime you switch Home/Gym. Unwell, I already contacted support. They didn't understand enough English to even understand the problem."
I like the app for kicking off my training routine again... but i am very bothered that you can not cancel subscription at a click of a button
"Don't PAY for this, it's rubbish, gymshark app it's 10 times better and free !!! Horrible customer service !!!! You won't get your money back !!!! And they keep deleting my review !! Be careful"
The only thing missing is a way to log the amount of weight you lift in each exercise. The workouts it provides are very efficient and seem to be properly difficult.
"Great app, good meals and easily usable interface"
Its not giving me my meal plan. It says tgat its expired to update my weight which I have and it still doesn't give me a meal plan.
"Programs and meals are good but could use some work. When doing the programs they are not made for you. No weight given for you to do, you are left to guess weight that you will be able to maintain."
"Good app. I just think it would be better if you could see the whole workout instead of all the videos that come with it and have to scroll down so much. Another thing I'd change would be to give the user a prescribed weight to start out with, not just the number of reps for the workout. Other than that, I have enjoyed the workouts that I've done and hope to see the app better develop over time."
"I just started , I like it so far"
screen rotates too sensitive.
Highly recommend you look for a free trial to test the app before you commit to any long-term subscription. Their refund policy clearly states they won't refund you your money if you hate the app and I'm in that situation currently. I should have tried it before I bought it. Don't make the mistake I made.
Scam. Does not allow you to cancel on the app. They put a filter that does not allow you to cancel. Stay away.
"Stop stealing from me! I made a one time payment for a program, now they are charging my card $50 monthly. I just called my bank to stop all recurring payments."
Waste. First update told me my plan expired
bugs. doesnt show you completed workout
"CANT CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION, WONT LET ME"
Scam. Took my money at sign in and then kept asking for more to get add ons or parts that were already part of the purchased package.
"No timer after set I have a full home gym, why is it telling me to lift water bottles? No recommendation on weight for workout prescribed...... I'm going back to FitBot after the 6 months Money wasted for anyone wanting to actually continue a fitness journey with a mobile app."
The subscription cancelation process is very cumbersome. They renew the subscription automatically and do not provide any intimation for it. The app does not let you cancel and you'd have to write to their support to get it canceled. Not happy at all.
"Totally useless app. There is no option to cancel subscription. In support section, no option to type from keyboard. No option to check with which email you are registered"
What's an update besides a Ukrainian flag? Staying outside of politics?
Worst app
"the meal plan is especially bad, not realistic at all. it all looks promising and comprehensive but it feels very robotic and not genuine."
"Pros - 1. Workouts are reasonable for the designated activity level that was setup, just be honest with yourself. 2. Has different workouts for amount of equipment available be it gym or at home with little to no equipment. 3. Videos of workouts. Cons - 1. In the current state, the meal planner seems to be a bit bugged or incomplete. 2. The option to have more/less rest days or allow for slight adjustments to preprogrammed workouts is not an option from what I have been able to test."
I can't cancel.my subscription
"ОСТОРОЖНО! НЕВОЗМОЖНО ОКЛЮЧИТЬ ПОДПИСКУ! До окончания пробного периода я отменил подписку через приложение. Однако в начале следующего месяца у меня сняли деньги в размере 19.99$. я несколько раз писал в службу поддержки, однако никакого ответа я не получил, кто автоматических писем. Деньги тоже не вернулись на карту."
Excercises not really aligned as per schedule
This is a good program just don't have time for it I received a full refund
"*BUG: Nutrition section in settings defaults to starting 100000 years in the future, causing meal plans not to show up for new arrivals like myself. I purchased these meal plans, and they weren't showing up for me until I changed this date in the app's settings. Making the default be current day or the date of purchase would be better I think. *Review: Great app for working out and working towards health and fitness. I wish there were more exercises that do not require equipment or water jugs."
"It was good for first week. I paid what they wanted. Days later more charges appearing in my bank account from them. Just another scam app. I paid what you wanted, stop being greedy."
I'm excited to use the app so i signed up and the charged me three times. One under a different name. Praying I get my money back
"Changing my review as the developers of the app have responded so positively to my latest complaint. I appreciate their sincerity and the matter is closed. That being said, the app isn't for me and I do not believe the suggested workouts are effective to help me reach my fitness goals."
"Just bad. Do not give them any money, all they want is data from you and are absolutely useless, filled with generic exercises. Scam"
Nice!
"This app really work, it's awesome"
Really basic.... Would like a refund!
"Terrible app, refused to provide a refund when it was so incredibly basic. Workouts are for old ladies, really pathetic. Pushups, then lunges and get ripped. Ridiculous. They then have a diet plan feature which has 5 fancy and expensive meals you need to prepare every day. Burgers today for lunch, fish tomorrow, casserole the next. Ridiculous too, who could do that every day. No-one else does this, they meal prep for the week. I told them all this and they tell you to skip workouts and meals"
"Okay wow. Lots of bad reviews for this. Lots of room for improvement in customization on the days you work out. 3 days is not enough for me. However, I picked a muscle gain-focused routine and that's what I got. Using a barbell, dumbell, flat bench, Incline, cables, machines, etc. Numerous exercises as well for chest, tris, back, bis, legs, abs, lats, traps, shoulders it's all there. I don't understand the problem some are having with only getting water bottle or bodyweight training?"
"Buyer Beware!!!! The ""free trial"" requires 14 consecutive days of use for a refund. Not clearly indicated - not ethical in my opinion. Lots of other options available"
The support team response time and solution where outstanding. I did not encounter the issue mentioned in some of the comments. Thank you for the support
Great app and personalized
Absolutely terrible
"Does not worth 40$ paid for it. Videos are half in Russian , половина на английском (half in English). Some videos are cut by time in the middle of exercise explanation. No signals or short indication between exercises if voice is turned off, have to check the phone all the time, very inconvenient. Labels with repetition counts in the videos don't match counts in program. Changed program level from 5 to 7, nothing changed in the program itself. And a lot more..."
A scam. App does not work. Programs don't load. £40 for nothing.
Impossible to communicate with anyone associated with this app. NO responses to my queries!
"The audio is low, the video control is lacking. Minimal chance control the flow of the video and to keep up to follow correctly"
"Awful workouts lackluster app. If you leave it to generate a workout in its own or only does one area. Therefore I would imagine it'll take over a month do work every muscle group, this is not frequent enough. It's a nice idea but the execution leave a lot to be desired. Don't be fooled by their unclear terms, refunds will be difficult/impossible. Apparently a bad opinion on their product is insufficient reason. Yeah I'd suggest buying the bodybuilding encyclopaedia by Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"It helped me to change bad eating habits and to see in a different way and enjoy the exercises, excellent for those of us who find it difficult to stop eating badly and leave anxiety behind, congratulations, you do an excellent job"
"Terrible customer service.. the app didn't work on my phone so I asked for a refund. They advised the most they would refund is 50% of my fee even though they could see I had never used the app because of bugs. So I ended up being forced to settle to pay 50% towards something I couldn't use... shocking. Stay way, they clearly don't care about customers and just want to drain your wallets."
"Regardless of the questionnaire, you get the same workouts. If you indicate a weaker chest and weaker legs... It's exactly the same workout as if you indicated just weak arms. I've changed my answers to the questionnaire numerous times, and it does not customize beyond pre-planned routines. Meals do not correspond to the daily calorie limit. Meals focus on high carb and low protein which makes no sense. Says to log water, but no way to do so."
"Unsubsribed after 1.5 months. There were results, yes. At the same time he app was glitching often - the screen were going black, but sound and countdown were still there. Another reason to unsubscribe - program does not match age and phisical condition. You can't allocate just 4 minutes for warm up. In the beginning I honestly said hat I can do only 3 deeps on horizontal bars. On the day 1 app tells me to do 3x6. How?"
"Fine at first but after doing these workouts for weeks and weeks, it just repeats the workouts and there's no consistency in the presentation of the workouts."
"Dissapointed ,this app will not do what is says based on these workouts.Ive been going to the gym 5 days a week for yrs and this workout is only 3 days a week.waste of money"
"Pretty good but room for improvement. The workouts automatically play right through, I'd like them to stop playing after 1 clip. The screen rotation is very annoying, it ignores the phone rotation lock. Should be able to swap one exercise if that machine is not in the gym. Should be able to move days, no way to tell it I only want to go to the gym on weekdays"
I am enjoying the gym programs created for me. But the workouts don't appear to be tailored based on the answers I gave in the assessment. For example I stated I couldn't do pull ups but then get given these in my workout.
honestly didn't expect any results from buying an app but super easy customizable workouts to at least get you moving
"This is a scam STAY AWAY FROM IT! The app doesn't provide what they promise, and they charge you every week. They also don't have 30-day money back guarantee as they write in the description. I have contacted the customer service and still no response. I have to figure out how to block them."
I cant unsubscribe from this app from my google play.
Poor
Good app!
"Before starting an exercise, need to give advance notice what exercise tools needed for a particular programme. Need more audio aid 10 seconds before start / stop / change an exercise, I can't be watching my smart phone screen all the time to follow the programme while exercising. Lighting for your exercise studio Need to be improved, it's made worst because of the dark grey background."
"So far I like the app and how it guides you through the whole exercise without constantly picking up your phone to select the next workout. I see reviews that the workouts are not tailored to the person and its just a basic workout plan, I disagree. The number of reps it has you perform is where they tailor it to you. I would like to see more exercises using equipment or options to use weights vs water bottles. Also a recommended weight to use on equipment would be very helpful and add to a tailored workout"
If you looking for free Apps. Don't download this
"Scam. Waste of time going through all the steps for a plan. Then you get hit with a pay wall. They say they won't use your email for any spam.. then they send many emails spamming you on ""deals"". Not worth the price."
"App very confusing to use, limited option to customize, need a refund"
Nice interface. Mild exercises
I was looking to provide exercises to workout at local gym. But in this app most of them for workout at home. Looking how to get my £30 back.
Scammy subscription renewal and nothing you couldn't get of free apps
Helpful during the pandemic for training at home
Language and sync issues within the application. Will count down in English but describe excercise in another. Video and audio not in sync. Although I selected intermediate excercises I continued to get beginner workout in my schedule and have to search the library for a similar one at an intermediate level.
App gets stuck on loading screen. I tried some troubleshooting but couldn't resolve so I asked them for a refund. They completely refuse to work with you because of their policy. Absolute crooks.
"App doesnt work properly, it assumes data instead of letting me input it, its an incomplete app, and the customer service is terrible, there are so many other services out there that provide a better basic foundation without the need for a subscription, they absolutely will not work with you if you meant to cancel the subscription, but the cancel didnt go through and the day after i saw it on my bank account again, tried to apply for a refund, and they refuse to get it even acknowledge it."
Originally a 4 star review with some critiques to make the user experience top notch. I'm now recommending to STAY AWAY. I just finished my first month and the meal planning no longer is available. It doesn't keep track that you completed the work out so my streak is literally resetting every day. I know thats a small thing but I genuinely felt good about getting the daily streak higher. Tldr scam app only good for getting your money the first month.
"very disappointed with this app, need to wait much long time download then can acess the coach video, the passion mood is losing when waiting the download"
How can i cancel subscribe.... It's renew and i didn't know that it will happend after first subscribe
The workouts on this app are pretty basic. Better off on your own to make your own workout rather than paying a overcharged price for this app.
Workouts are too simplistic. Following this regime is weak. Better off doing P90X
"What a scam... I can't believe I paid them a dollar. I am new to the gym. So thought this should help me figure out a good system. I was sold on the idea that is is a ""customized workout program"". Well it isn't. For example. They had a bunch of questions I had to answer. They asked if I can do any pull-ups. I answered no. Well guess what was the first workout of the customized program... it was 15 pull-ups. I go to the gym everyday... they gave me a break every other day. No money back either."
Мошенники чистой воды
Garbage
you need to pay every week. thank you.
Charge weekly $10.70 did not know.
Ok so here is the thing. They may try and charge you weekly I was shocked when I got billed £7.99 two weeks in a row. BUT I emailed them. We came to a good resolution (in less than 12 hours). They know the price point is high. I am now paying £19.99 per 6 months. Which I think is fair.
"Very structured, I just work too much on my y farm to have the time or energy to complete this."
"I tried the program for a week, it has a decent features, good workout plan and diet. The diet plan also has grocery list and step-by-step preparation."
"***""READ**"" the details of the ""Money Back Guarantee"" BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!! ) BC I didn't.. my bad,you got me. LOL"
Wrong charging
"First of all, the add was cleverly disguised, so I did not realize, that I was leaving the page of my interest. Secondly, paying $9.99 I never realized, that the price is not for the whole 6 months program, but for one week ($520 a year!). Thirdly, the app itself is very mediocre, positions are not shown but from one angle; description is very poor, sometimes in Russian (I purchased), sometimes in English; moves are shown superficially: one side it is step-and-squat, the opposite move it is step-then-squat."
"I didn’t read the app's feedbacks and it’s my mistake. I was buying a course of exercises, and in the mail I got a message that I was paying $ 9.99 every week. Wrote in support, if the money is not returned, l will have to contact the police"
"Terrible customer service. It says billed weekly but I was charged $40 then attempted to cancel and couldn't. I have again been charged $50 today when I havent even been using it. I could find no emails from them, no login information and instead of a refund they offered 6 months free... You're better off getting some face to face advice from your local gym. Awful"
"Be aware, they drive you to buy subscription for 6 months, after you pay, they send you email that it is for 7 days, 16 usd fir 7 days, !!!"
17 dollars every week is pretty scammy. I deleted my account today please do not charge me again.
I was not happy with the app n mad muscles refunded me in full. Thank you.
Its not what they offer
"Nicely produced videos, easy to navigate the app itself. Great Customer Services thanks to Lucy, who responded immediately. Read the other comments then read this one again. This app is perfect for home or gym, and cheaper than a gym membership and trainer. You WILL lose weight and firm up using this app. I had DOMS in every last upper body muscle for 5 days after my first session, so keep difficulty low to start with and it'll work a dream."
Rip Off. They lied about their plan then tried to make me pay more so I instead tried to get a refund but they wouldn't give it to me. One of the worse fitness apps ever.
*** SCAM BEWARE ***
"I cannot log water or food, but the notifications ask me to, that's annoying"
6.99$ every week... +12.99 for meal program every week. It's very expensive for simple app!
Took my money and sent me nothing
"The bottom line is that there are a suite of similar products that are cheaper with more features. If this app adds meal and water tracking, I think that it will be worth the money and I'd be willing to upgrade my review to five stars. As of now, it really isn't. There's no difficulty progression as far as I can tell and the survey of ""goals"" that I took before buying aren't present in the app anywhere. The only ""goal"" is weight loss which is probably what I care about the least."
"I don't know how you are getting all these fake rating and getting away with cyber-scamming. But your app sucks and if anyone is reading this. Please don't purchase check the rating carefully. There are only a few who rate 5 star but over hundreds who vote 1 star. Don't get scam. The rating is fake, billing is a scam and most importantly the app itself is trash"
I was mislead into thinking that I was purchasing a 6 month workout plan.
"""Full Equipment"" seems to be a pull up bar and water bottles. The meals are cool."
Takes money and lie about costs
"No gym?! Even on the highest intensity, this is EXTREMELY easy compared to my normal routine. I'm asking for my money back now."
Mad Muscles is a good app to use for your exercise goals.
Thought I was buying a 6 month workout plan I could use when I was ready but found out after being billed for a third time it's a subscription. Also from the other reviews the frequency of billing seems based on your workout plan. They don't outline the billing process before you sign up and it makes it all very misleading.
Its a scam. They steal in a nice way.
Terrible set of people Give me an option for 1 month After paying they were still charging me weekly Then I was sent a mail that my subscription has been canceled Surprisingly I was debited again on Monday Had to block my account to prevent further debit This is so terrible Never seen an app that the organisers are busy cheating subscriber
Deceptive and predatory subscription model.
"THEY CHARGE WEEKLY. Didn't realize they were trying to charge me $40 a month until the second payment hit. I contacted their support at the very beginning of the new week, let them know I cancelled, and asked for a refund for the unused week. They declined. Petty. If two people don't use the app based on my review they will have lost double what they're withholding. When will these companies learn, bad support costs big."
I love this app how it always reminds you for your daily water intake and the type of food you can take. But I am not happy with $16 for every 7 days. It's kind of expensive. That is pretty basic it's nothing major to it. I'm not able to log my intake of the food and know the calories I'm eating. Calories in carbs and proteins are based on the meal that's prepared not what you're supposed to take. I wish the developer best of luck with this app they need to make it worth $16 or 7 days.
Waiting hours for app to download
"I would like my money back please. I reach out to you support team and they were no help. Don't get this app, it's a scam"
"The app is good, I like how it evaluate a proper workouts according to fitness but it would be great if there's an offline mode"
Great
"Not the best app. I can't tell when my subscription ends. App isn't easy to follow, too many workout choices. I specifically said I had no equipment and the instructor starts lifting a 6 liter water bottle in each hand. Like I have 2 6L water bottles laying around."
I am very disappointed in the app and this whole product. The app just gives some exercise and assistance and the rest you have to pay for. They deducted funds every 7 days and I still don't know exactly what it was for. Would not recommend this to anyone.
"Waste of time and money. Honestly, don't download it. I promise you will regret it instantly. There are better apps that actually deliver on sound advice, exercise and support from the developers."
Not what I thought it would be. After my training coach checked out the application he said you could do better than this. I agree with an other user the food setup are good but.. the overall just not worth it. Please refund asap.
"After 4 months of using this app, all the workouts are old now, no update, I really love this app, but they need to keep updating their workouts!!!"
Deberían informar bien el tiempo que dura la suscripción. Te cobran 10 dólares por semana para un plan de 6 meses.
The subscription model is predatory! Avoid!
"Went with the 3 month plan... Waste of money. I tried a few of the workouts and they were so basic, even the advanced options. The meal plan had good food, just difficult to use, such as measuring everything in oz even when it doesn't make sense to. Oh well, I guess thats $50 I'm not getting back."
MISLEADING ONLY HOME WORKOUTS AND THEY DONT HONOR REFUNDS WITH AN INSTANT SAME DAY CANCELLATION. TERRIBLE.
"At first glance this app looked pretty good, but after a month of use i found it very repetitive and shallow in workout content. Within 2 months i had completely stopped using it."
The full equipment workout barely use any equipment. The food plan is an additional cost. There is not easy method to cancel or get a rebate. Cannot recommend at all.
Joke of an app
Сложно отклонить подписку. Снимают деньги каждую неделю
This app is a scamm it gives you a plan but will nonstop charge small amounts of money slowly draining your bank account
Huawei is the parent company. Need to go burn my phone I guess.
"So app and everything is good build but In app when it gives you workouts there all the workouts doesn't involve going gym, all they give you is pull up push ups there no machinery, bench presses nothing to do with gym, it's like home workout. Even tho I chose I have full equipment"
Worthless
Unsubscribing. Using bottles instead of dumbbell -- why? Its charge you weekly... which i was not aware about.
"I have been using this app for a few months now and find that it guides me though routines that help strengthen my body while not over working it to injury. Coming from an ""all or nothing"", ""no pain no gain"" mentality and never getting the proper training, this app helps minimize injury and maximize fitness. I would like to see some graphics changes. Some graphics that show the targeted muscle groups and some front on camera angles of the motions so I know what I'm supposed to look like."
Very disappointed -Too expensive for a bad app -You LL have to purchase means plan separately -it s only on YOUR phone can't use it on computer screen or tv for larger view -boring -robotic voice -no ambiant music -hard to understand the app at the beggining -no synchronization between time & voice & video Don't waste Your time to try it !
"Don't purchase this, it's too spencive, every week they charge you 17 dollars , the meals are so difficult to make, the program is not personalized at all, they have the same videos for everything, it's kind of a scam.."
How the hell these guys changing ratings
This program is not what it is advertised to be. Full gym equipment not.
Disappointed
I personally would like it more if the workouts could be cast to a Chromecast or download the app to the Chromecast TV.
"You will be billed 16.98 USD on a weekly basis for anything you sign up for. It starts by you giving your physical info for a tailored workout program and meal plan... once given you'll need to pay to access them. This payment is NOT a one time payment, it is a weekly subscription. There is no where to access account or subscription info on the app or website, yet you'll continue to have a subscription with them 🤔. To cancel, you'll have to email them - how convenient is that !?"
"Nice app, works well, and contains a good, well thought out set of exercises"
A subscription service with no option to opt out of the subscription...
I want to cancel.
Boring workouts. Why ask if you have access to a gym if there's no gym equipment in these workouts. Do you expect me to bring jugs of water to the gym to do some of these routines? Do you expect me lay on the dirty gym floor to do some of these workouts? This app is only for people with no gym membership who need a home routine and should be clearly advertised as such.
Extremely unhappy with the amount of data spent and the content not available to me in PDF
I canceled subscription and still got charged 7 days after I did so...rip off!
"Why is the app asking how much equipment I have access too if, no matter what you choose, it's all body weight exercises and movements using water bottles as weights. If this app was advertised as being a body weight only app the it would have been easier for me to not bother downloading it and wasting my money."
"Your service is fraud and scam :) without mentioning clearly that what is the duration of subscription and wrongly mentioning free trial, you guys just suck off the money from people."
"I have been working out at home for many years now with minimal results. I am not the going to the gym type but with Mad Muscles a plan was specifically designed for me to target my problem areas in addition to my overall fitness and body sculpting. I recently started this program and right away I knew it was different and a lot of science went into it. The exercises are intense yet manageable, the duration of time is great. This is the program. The results so far are phenomenal. This works."
"Do not purchase! So disappointed and waste of money. Based on years of lifting weights and tracking macros there's no way this will get me better results. If you are new to exercising, maybe this will help. But...Subscription fee is way too high! Money back guarantee is impossible to get. Equipment selection is poor. Volume and frequency for advanced trainers is not sufficient. Meal plan is overly complicated. Tracking is too basic. Overall, not what was advertised."
"No Excercise in the gym,, not fit for the advance training, Dont pay"
"It is a scam! I purchased a subscription and never received an access code to use the app. I checked spam and even emailed the various emails accounts associated with this program. No response. Now I'm trying to prevent future charges to my account. I can't even update my billing information b/c I don't have access to login. A word to the wise, read the reviews first. If I had read the reviews prior to purchasing I would have never downloaded the app."
"Unlike 1 star reviewers on here, I knew it was a weekly charge. It says ""Charged weekly"" right under the line with the cost. The reason I am only giving it 2 stars is because of how bad the video playback is. As other reviewers mention, the videos are just a person performing the workout, while a narrator gives instructions. The problem is that the audio is very out of sync from the video. To charge this much, and have that problem is a deal breaker for me. Requested cancellation via email."
Do not pay for this. Disappointing is an understatement. No matter what you set to your challenge level you get very mediocre body weight routines. The whole workout should be considered a warmup. Oh and you can only cancel by emailing them. Should have read the reviews first instead of trying it on a whim...
This is just rubbish it's fake just stole your money never try it
"I try to cancel it and is very difficult, then charge me even if I cancelled the subscription. I think this is a cheat!"
"Формально делают что обещано. Очень все хорошо презентовано, повелся и подписался на три месяца за 40 долларов. Прозаниматься хватило на неделю. По истечение 3-х месяцев напомнили о себе списанием еще 40 долларов. Отписаться от сервиса сложно. Напоминаний о списаниях, разумеется, нет."
Unfortunately this App is not what I was looking for. I will upgrade to a 5 star if they honor the trial period and do not charge me. I joined today and went through the app. The app is well done but I am looking for more weight training not bands and planks. I hope they honor the trial period. I sent an email to the correct email address and cancelled today.
This app is not really useful. I am sorry I spent my money on this app. It does not help all this information given you can find on Google for free.
I couldn't understand the automatic payment after 7 days after 1st payment. Can't put zero star so 1 star.
You go through a ton of questions and personal info just for them to give you a ridiculous price at the end
"I paid for it and they didn't deliver what was promised, contacted them for a full refund, denied however what I opted in for was not honored. It's a scam."
"Dicen que el plan dura 6 meses pero nunca dicen que el pago que se hará es semanal, además la interfase gráfica está muy mal."
"This program is nothing that is advertised. The workouts state ""full equipment"" and nearly all of the exercises are body weight. I checked weeks down the road and the exercises are the same. Just a terrible workout program. Within in days of downloading the program, I requested a refund because I knew it wasn't what I wanted. To get a refund, I had to follow a program that I didn't want for 14 days. Save your money and do your push ups on your own."
"💩 service! I requested the cancellation of the subscription twice. it's been two weeks now , no cancelattion, and they keep billing me. When I subscribed, I was let bo belive that it was a OTP, not a 7 day subscription! I will report them."
Be careful with this app. I would not recommend. Kept charging me for the program and very difficult to cancel. Not transparent with how app is operated. Check it out carefully. Read the reviews etc. Before deciding to purchase. Bless.
Listen carefully! I realized they deleted my one star review twice! I intentionally wanted to come and check it. Twice it's not there. This is a useless app don't waste ur money. It does not offer the gym equipment as advertised
Spam and hackers in rebilling us
This is a fund app. I have emailed your support team twice and you still won't cancel my subscription. FRAUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keeps on crashing whenever i try to register.
Trash. Crooks. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS. IT WILL END IN TEARS.
Keep on billing me. Why do you keep on billing me weekly. You only indicated a once off purchase price. You owe me my money back
"Attention before you install ! 1. Note that they charge 10$ every week 2. You can only cancel your subscription through an email despite they claim that you can do it using google service. Application subscription doesn't appear in google play list. I sent a request with cancellation request twice, no one answered me. Bottom line - Not recommend !!!"
I wanted to cancel this subscription so I sent an email to the support team and yet they still charged me$29.99 I did this the same day that I downloaded the app so I still had plenty of time before the free period was up...just sent another email hopefully they will cancel it this time
"It is poorly advertised, their idea of full gym equipment is a power tower and some dumbbells, it's not clear that it is a subscription based service, my fault for not looking harder, but the app itself is well put together and easy to navigate"
Will not let me cancel subscription. Very misleading app.
Good enough workout routines. Although i dont particularly like some of the workout names but no big deal. The app itself i have some issues with. Audio and video is not in sync especially in the warm ups. There is no rest indication between exercises. I would have love to choose the specific days that make up my 5 day exercise routine.
Не подписывайтесь на это приложение. Снимают деньги с вашей карты незаконно!
DON'T PAY FOR THIS APP !!! IS TOTALLY USELESS
They are just thiefs saying you get a workout program for 10$ for a 6 month period just don't download it bad app
"Very High Quality, really i can appreciatted in the level of attention to details and tailored customization to your needs. The killing heels of this app is its price. 10 dolars weekly. if you are going to install it try hard no loose your time or money not attending excercises."
"This is some 🐂 💩,now you have to buy meal plans you should have said that before you charge someone. You can have the damn money. Hope you are happy with stealing people's money,....."
Not one Exercise geared to actually working out in the gym and gaining muscle. Half of it is done with body weight.. I took a gamble by paying for it without it showing you any of the workouts and I'm very disappointed $20 down the drain for body weight workout workout. I'm a regular in the gym and was really hoping for A gym based program that would actually allow me to hit my fitness goals of gaining 10 pounds This is not that.
This app trying to charge me extra 16$ after 1 week of using it I'm so disappointed
It's an amazing app. Perfect for beginners who need a long term healthy living exercise plan. They didn't promise me to get my endomorph overweight body to get lean fat free in 2 weeks. They gave me the most suitable exercises which I like and can do at home.
App is HORRIBLE and based on these reviews I need to put a stop payment on them before they charge me a second time
This is one of the worst apps I've ever came across and one of the worst billing methods ever. I've paid for my subscription and never even got a receipt for my payment. They make it hard on purpose to cancel the subscription to keep rebilling you... DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!!
CHARGING EVERY WEEK! REPORT THIS PLEASE EVERYONE!!
"I paid ZAR 148 for this thinking it is a once of payment and it includes a customized eating plan. I discovered that no 1.It is Not a once off payment. AND No. 2 I have to pay ANOTHER ZAR 175. to get access to the eating plan. THIS IS A SCAM. STAY AWAY. There are way better Apps that is Totally free.! Like Jefit and Dumbell Only 30-day. Home Work Out. Update: 31/07 When I signed up for this money-stealing app a week ago, $10 (148 ZAR )was deducted from my debit card. Just now, a week later, ANOTHER $10 ( 14"
Worst app ever
"Do not subscribe, you will think it is a 1 time payment for the app, but they are charging you on weekly basis!"
"Extremely bad application , mainly depends on body weight workout with no variation!"
"I was under the impression that it was a onetime payment, but I keep getting a 20$ charge every week. No where did it say it was a weekly subscription."
Terrible SCAM. Do NOT download!!!!
Purchased this app assuming it was for gym work outs. All it has is at home work outs with water bottles and resistance bands. Want a refund as this is terrible and not specific for individual needs.
"Scammers who never give your money back, even if you never used their poor service!"
This is a scam I didn't know you pay 10 weekly I want my money back now respond to my emails
"I literally was at the point of paying for this workout, but something just tells me to go to playstore and check the reviews, and yelp am not so sure about this anymore."
"Terrible app and customer service, tried to used the app and services but the app doesn't load or display any of the claimed services. Tried to cancel subscription and was given ""troubleshooting"" tips that did not help and still no help to cancel the subscription from the customer service."
"Hi, when i paid for the 6 months program, i was of the view that it was a one off payment of 10$ for 6 months. However, i was charged again in less than 10 days the same amount of 10$, making it $20 in 10 days. And i think after a period of 10 days this application will again charge me 10$. This application says that i can cancel my subscription from google playstore, however as per google playstore, i am not even subscribed to any subscription. Due to this application i had to block my atm card"
I can't open full notifications. Why?
Didn't really follow it.
"I doesn't open, all i see is the logo, i paid for the plan, now I can't access it, what's going on? I even reinstalled it, but nothing changes"
"Improved greatly from a few months ago, and very motivating now. Some issues: in warmup there is no sync between the video and voice. I can see reminders only when i open the app, so if it's closed i miss them Hope will be fixed"
This requires internet and still at high speed does not download content. Better look elsewhere.
"For the price point, it's not worth it. Not a user friendly experience. I get a better experience with Freeletics and at a better price point than with this app."
"The video start first while the audio delay like 10-15 seconds, when I paused it, only the audio pausef, video still continue"
The exercises is nothing personal how can a very overweight obese do pull ups and push ups when setuping u asked and i said i cant do those refund me pls I dont want to use it
"The program was descent, and the workouts were fairly good. The problem is the nefarious setup in the subscription model. This is set up in a manner to rip people off versus the economic model of growth. Instead of attracting growth of customers at an exponential level, they are operating in a manner similar to a used car salesman or a thief. As soon as I saw the reviews stating this is being charge weekly, I began immediately canceling, and if it's not immediate the bank will refund it for me as well as se"
"Waste of money I've been charged $50 during this month and can't even access to the app, total scam, I want my money back!"
"This is a scam. They will take all your money and provide no value, and make it very difficult to end subscription. I contacted them about my account and they said that there is no reoccurring billing which was a lie because I've had multiple $44 transactions taken out. WARNING: DO NOT FALL FOR THIS, THEY WILL ROB YOU BLIND."
"Please stop taking money from my debit card , I already deleted it from my phone ."
It says no where about weekly payment and then... You have to email the publisher to unsuscribe... Training is good but for 40$/month I can go to Gym.
The billing program it's a shame and not clear. Cancel your subscription immediately or you will be charged every 10 days without any warning in 9.99USD. No More Payments its online steal.
"STAY AWAY! SCAM ALLERT!!! This App is a scam. I started a free trial and suddenly I am charged every week AND I can't subscribe from it on Google Play as it doesn't show under my subscriptions! THIS APP IS DESIGNED TO STEAL MONEY!!! EDIT: Subsequent to this review, I got emails from Uniwell wherein they apologised and undertook to cancel my subscription and to stop any further payments from my account. It is still to be seen if any further payments go off or not."
No clear information about payment being weekly; no notification when they're charging you; No notification at least for the workout so to create a habit And best all ....you cannot unsubscribe that easily...
Total scam! Nowhere during subscription was saying there will be charge by week. They are taking my money on a weekly basis. and nowhere to cancel my subscription.
This app is fraud. Do not subscribe you cannot unsubscribe later. The unsubscribe option does not exists.
"Terrible experience, it's not clear about payment, they took my money by week since I installed the app. I can't find my subscription on Google play to cancel. Worst app."
"They deducted the fees every 5 days although in the beginning they said it will be paid once, i asked them to solve the problem and they said send us an email on the Help support, i sent but nothing happened, don't install it"
Super glitchy. Impossible to follow the videos and times as they interrupt each other by moving to the next one every 5 seconds.
Bad experience Do not install it Horrible to me Just to deduct 9.9 $ without any benifit
I am really shocked why would i pay again and again every few days ?!!!! I want my money back as soon as posible . This is scamers!!! I'm waiting for a refund or I'll go for google play.
"Charges you every 5 days, the same amount, aprox. 17$, although they make you belive its a one time payment. Also, they will not refund because ""you have to camcel in the first 24 hours"", or they will charge you twice. You can only cancel subsctiption by email. Just another way for thiefs to be thiefs."
Charging me 10 every week
"Sketchy Company. Hides the fact this is a subscription. So the real cost per year is over $120. Tried to cancel for a refund 10 min after purchase and they are refusing to refund my money. Claim something in the fine print makes it undefinable unless you ""didn't see results"". Which is beyond arbitrary. This is a scam company and should be reported to whoever governs who is allowed to sell via Google play. Avoid this one like the plague. Let my $10 mistake be a warning for everyone else."
Charges every week.. Must be crazy..
first app to get me in the Grove cus it's tell you everything you need to to get started including a menu and grocery list
"Absolutely horrible! Just saw an email from them saying they'll charge me USD 9.99 for the next subscription period. Nowhere during the buying process does it say I'll be charged AGAIN after a few days! This is just insane!!! Who does this to people?? Absolute scammers!! I have just sent them an email to get me the refund ASAP or I'd go through Google Play to get it, and I've just received an email from PayPal and Mad Muscles saying that a refund of USD 9.99 has just been processed. NEVER AGAIN!"
Very good but I wish it had an option to change fat percentage
"Description about the payment is not clear. I payed service and thought that it was one time payment, instead I was subscribed for weekly payment. Service is not worth the money."
Even when I selected that I have full equipment available it keep offerig bodyweight and band excercises. I give it three start as it may be OK for soneone working from home without access to full gym gear.
"Poor service, I want my money back! or I'm going to demand you!"
Poor workouts useless I tried fitness & bodybuilding and other app there a library of workouts for each muscle Again very poor app
Just don't purchase any subscription or else you'll regret.
It is a super frustrating app for workouts. The UI looks perfect but the content is frustrating for example if I selected advance gym lower body workout out it gives exercises with water bottle !! In addition to non intuition presentation of plants Too bad for u guys in 2021 u still do these mistakes
It's super expensive and very basic programme (which can be found for free in other websites).
I have dowoaded app and paied $10 ut there is no any perticular shedule for me. Please help me as im dont find it
Very basic
Watch out! No clear billing. It's hidden and you can only cancel by contacting them. The app looks great but they way they take your money does not.
"You don't get any workout plan, you receive a list of random ""recommended workouts"" The meal plan is very constrictive, only giving a few options, none of which are too appealing imo And you only have the choice of ""full gym"" or ""limited"" which is resistance bands and dumbbells... No option to add other equipment you might have Only saving grace, it was cheap, so I've only lost $40, but honestly, don't waste your money"
"A whole load of bollocks. Should have known its too good to be true, but I'm okay to have lost money otherwise I would always have wondered if it's worth it. I unsubscribed 3 minutes after paying and exploring the app. The way this is presented on social media leads you on. There are far more better workout apps out there that are free. Don't waste you money"
I paid 10$ and think it is one time pay. But i was charged 10$ more after 1 week. I sent an email to cancel my subscription right away.
"I was charged twice with in a week, and this app dose not show under subscription list in Google play to unsubscribe even. wrote a mail to the support team to unsubscribe and no response yet"
Sad money grab. Realized how much of a scam this was when started to look at the meals and meal prep. This is could have been done better by a group of high school students.
Worse app
Don't effective and wast time
"hello give my money back, u already charged me 2 times, first it say only 1 time,dont lie, u will rot in hell if not give back my money"
This is a $10 subscription app which renews every 7 days. They did not mention anywhere that this 8s subscription based app
I Paid 10$ for the app and then after a week they charge me again for a subcription that i didnt subsrcibe or agree with. this is a scam
"Nothing personalised to what I asked,i mentioned no equipment and still have most workouts requiring equipments, and for the water bottles, do you guys really think that i got 2 6L water bottles lying at home? I don't even buy bottled water and we don't have that big one here where i live. You guys just take people's money without delivering any good product. It's just a scam, had i read other reviews before buying i wouldn't have done it, i was just an idiot to believe your ad and purchase it"
"It has many, many 'different' sets which are all basically the same. They actually sell only a handfull of excersises which are in different order in different sets. Not what I hoped for."
Waste of money. Data greedy. Can't adjust times for different lifestyles. And what the hell is 1.6 eggs? Just dumb.
I paid 10$ thinking that it was one time. I was charged 10$ again after just 10 days. Custom service says it's subscription based and I have to cancel subscription 10 days before which is when I installed the app. Also I installed the app to check if there is any way I could unsubscribe but didn't find any.
Not good workouts
Scam
Very good apps !
"I paid, but I didn't get any plan"
Horrible app!!! Took my money and doesn't even allow me to log in. Keeps sending me codes without ever reaching my email account. I want my money back !!!
I have tried signing in million times and havent receive my security code until now. Seems like Fraud and wastage of money.
Day 2 of using this app and I'm loving it. I love the notifications and reminders. I'm excited about the journey to fitness.
notifications are very helpful for establishing healthy patterns
"Overall I like the app. Definitely good for quarantine. Could you add a feature to log water intake, which will help me stay motivated to drink the recommended amount?"
I like the workouts and the layout and guidelines. But I do wish there was an actual person doing the workout with me and training me as opposed to listening to the computer animated voice and watching a soundless video of someone doing the workout but not really helping me.
Not a very good.
Do not waste your money with this app. The workouts are repeated multiple times and just named different. Would give 0 stars if it was an option
Absolute garbage app. Company won't refund either.
The advertising which I responded to let me to believe that I would be getting a nutrition plan I really didn't care about the exercises because there's tons of those on the internet already I was specifically interested in the nutrition plan paid $30 got the okay exercises went to the nutrition plan and discovered it was an additional $12 to download a One WEEK meal plan. I AM REQUESTING MY MONEY TO BE RETURNED TO ME.
I don't know what people are expecting from a 'personal' training/nutrition app that you pay a one time fee of $40 for but it appears that this app is being run in to the ground. It's completely unwarranted. My experience with the app has been all positives. It can be hard to find effective workouts when you do most of your training at home. This app has been a great 'guideline' for me through the workouts and meal plans. Thank you for developing it.
"Worthless, as soon as i saw the ""personalized"" (read cookie cutter) workouts and meal plans i knew i wished i could get my money back."
"The devs won't issue a refund no matter what you try. Stay away from these cash grabbers at all cost and find literally anything else. If you're reading devs, issue me a refund and I'll remove this review."
"The workouts are all well and good, I can feel the strain. It would help massively if calories burned per day was recorded. Until then the app is ultimately useless."
There is absolutely nothing special and personalized about these work outs. The exercises are beyond basic I understand if you're trying to tone up but I wanted to gain muscle. The meal plan is also too complex with very little protein intake. It's without a doubt the worst investment I've made. I should have known better seeing it on Instagram smh 🤦‍♂️
it's a great way to get into shape . should have done it a long time ago 😃
The app does not allow me to change my weight goal. Not good at all.
This did not give me the option to choose things I couldn't eat on my meal plan before it set it up.
Information is lacking
"I installed the App two days ago, I subscribed to their 6 month plan. The app provide very simple and basic function. Which could be something good, but they need to enhance a little bit the options and features to have an overview of the monthly plan ..etc It's quite standard plan, not as specific or customized as they were marketing, but I feel happy to see some basic training to do at home.If you are looking for a basic start of getting a training schedule like me, this app is for you!"
Very basic and not worth the money...nothing that can't be seen on YouTube....can't even change your goal weight etc
"horrible app, no instruction, shopping list is not concise, it would nice if you could shop for the week or a few days and be ready to meal prep. workouts had stupid descriptions. it is obvious the workout is not personalized it is just a program with a database of other workouts. without good instruction how the hell are you suppose to complete 15 workouts and 15 meals and either take a photo or video to even get a refund. TOTAL RIPOFF. it is obvious even the response to reviews is automated."
Not worth it
Not what it was advertised as i need somethin on a personal level i want my money back! Im deploying overseas and want a decent app.
"This is a lack luster useless system for anyone looking to get proper exercise mechanics and build actual muscle mass. The only people I would begrudgingly recommend this system to would be someone who has never lifted a weight in their life, and has no aspirations of going to an actual gym. In case you're curious, the system utilizes mostly body weight and/or 6L water bottles as resistance. Some band work is also thrown in. However for anyone with any experience lifting, you will find this a laughable wast"
Rich content but horrible app.
One star because it would not let me continue with no stars. When you use the filter option for workouts it comes back with nothing. Marketed to be much better than it really is. Not worth the price.
"Degraded from 2 stars to 1 star. Customer service is terrible, apparently they can respond hete within 1 hour but through email they never respond. Refund requests are just completely ignored and promises are not kept. This is just a scam"
There are view personalization available for individual needs compared other platforms available in the market
Started great but after a week ot quit sending me notifications to remind me when to eat and drink. The meal plans are a joke. Half the ingredients they want you to buy aren't available at your average grocery store. Plus the meals are so limited i can't even use most of them. The workouts are fine but still lacking.
"This app is a scam, they offer a lot and then after you pay you get a very simple, very poor selection of workouts, no usability, no functions, nothing! After 10 mins using it and realizing this I asked for a refund and they told me no. Total scam! Beware!"
"Multiple days of work outs aren't recorded, it just resets it everyday and it doesn't change the exercises it chooses one for you and never changes it. Don't have an option to choose the food you want or to say you don't want to use it. Waste of money don't buy it!!!"
I've purchased the 6 month program and they didn't send me anything I felt like I got robbed.
Didn't meet my expectations. This app is very generic. I should not have spent any money on it.
Terrible. Should've read the reviews. I purchased at 7AM and still don't have access to the app because their system won't send a 4 digit code to my email. Tried to contact customer with no reply going on 12 hours now. I can't even get Inside the app to cancel the auto pay. Off to the bank to dispute the charge as a scam I guess.
"Really not happy with this app. I haven't received any response from the company. I emailed and no response from a so called trainer, took money and give you a basic at home exercise with no explanation why. OMG, this response is from the developer is priceless. It literally says in the 3 sentence that I had already emailed them and they give me a response saying please email us. OMG auto generated responses. Typical of a 3 generation company."
"Terrible customer service! I purchased this app because it sounded interesting and they sell it well. Unfortunately, I should of paid attention to other reviews and the many 2 star rating because once I started using the app, I quickly realized how it is not as described. Unhappy with my purchase and 30 minutes later I decided to cancel my automatic withdrawal and subscription through google. I then contacted Mad Muscles to get a refund but was told that there would be no refund because it was not their fau"
"There is no customisation in the training, you subscribe and open the app and you have some random training programs which are not good for a gym, just free body and dumbbells.The ingredients for the meals seem very specific for some areas and not easy to find otherwise.Vegemite, really?Also apparently by signing the contract you give up the right to any refund policy that might apply in your country, unless you meet their impossible standards.Really a nice scam move.Such a waste of money."
"after the first set of exercises, program flicks through the next two sets without pause. unless you are superman, forget it. quite disappointing"
only day 2 but not so sour I want to quit. years ago I used to lift but at my age (57) I know it will be a process to get back in shape. After all it has been almost 30 years.
"Lacking options in meals section. To combine, to rechoose what you prefer. I chose NO meat but there is a recipe with duck, chicken etc. For a paid app it should be much more options and offers included. Where are the food challenges? 30 day no junk food challenge, it does not appear in app. Exercises are fine, but that's not enough guys. Also a BUG, when exercise is interrupted I cannot resume training only restart. :/"
I sweat a lot on my first day
Poor unspecified plan provided.
There are no workouts or high intensity activities. this is only a collection of light exercises you can do. This workout is just not going to help me reach my goals. Total waste of money
"This app is generic and not worth the price whatsoever. With workout programs best for low level fitness athletes that would be written with less than any education. They are not tailored to the individual in any way shape or form. They are not lifting or powerlifting workouts taylored in the gym. They offer no refunds and have terrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. For $40 buy an Onnit program to get good workouts from a real reputable company. Do better ""Mad Muscles."""
To make it simple don't pay its not worth the money nothing givin as expected totally useless app
Terrible fraud: the application has nothing to do with what is advertised. There is no personalization or guidance. I tried contacting customer support but they never got back to me.
I like this MM works for me!
Its supposed that there is a program for 6 months !! No programm but the same exercises every day !! Where is the plan
Really disappointing
"No promised gym routines at all, when you realize that this app not what you was expecting you find out that $39 not refundable even next day after the payment, zero personalization to the customers need, everything you will find is general fitness exercises. Sorry app store doesn't have negative rating... Will definitely not renew my subscription."
👍
Terrible fitness app. It amounts to nothing more than a list of workouts that they found in 2 minutes on the internet. The personalized meal plan is ridiculous. It requires 72 different spices and ingredients that nobody buys. They can keep my money. I should have known better. That's the price I pay for getting scammed. Edit. Generic response copied and pasted from dozens of other one stereo reviews.
Personalised meal plans are basically the 18 different recipes but multiplied by the calories ratio you need to meet your goal. For example adding 2.6 eggs to a recipe. How do you add 0.6 of an egg? This business has spent more thought on the marketing campaign than the app itself. Please put your cut and paste reply below this review so all can see how fake you are.
"The instruction is quite lacking as far as the program goes, can't view the routine as an over all layer out program. Timed exercises don't have an actual time instruction just ""do for 1 rep"" What is one rep of plank.????? 😑"
The app is very stupied and unhelpful Could any one help me to unsubscripe
I recommend paying through PayPal as they will give refunds or just don't waste your money. I have a full gym set up and selected that and I went through every workout option and they are all floor workouts with maybe a dumbell here and there. I also selected that I was fit and could do over 30 push-ups for the questions and then I looked at their most advanced workout with full equipment and again only one dumbell and the whole workout is a breeze for both me and my wife.
"The menu is ok. I had issues with recipes giving oven temperatures that will not cook food. Also not a lot of ability to cater to your needs after the lengthy survey. Does not allow customized menus. Also does not allow options for allergens. I'm allergic to peanuts, and soy, which is heavily in their menu. The exercises are good quality. I just wish I could add options on the routines."
Meals plans will take hours to prep. Waiting for a less complex meal plan. 15mins work outs 3 times a week..... what a joke.
"Generic garbage workout app. Claims to be personalised and tailored to your needs, but it's all completely unrelated to any of the questions you answer upon sign up. Recipes look interesting, but not really sustainable. No workout plan, just a collection of videos. Not worth the money at all, wouldn't mind paying maybe $5 for it. Wish I'd read reviews before paying as their refund policy is ridiculous. Won't be recommending to anybody and definitely won't be renewing my subscription."
Not even close to a personalised workout program. Their shopping list section is a joke as it only provides a shopping list for each day. Who goes shopping everyday?
"The worst customer service ever! I got a bad workout program, that meant to be customized for me!!!! That is clearly not my level or my target! And have sent multiple support emails, and no one answered or even replied!! SCAM!"
"It doesn't have workout log history. Its not personalised. Gives some workouts but no plan what so ever. Better get a free app for workout than pay for nothing. Gives a weight log witch you can basically write on a paper by yourself. Absolute waist of money. update: Now I can barely run the app. it doesn't download the programs and when it actually does, I have to download every exercise separately. most of the time now I cant even see the instructions of the exercise cause it doesn't run the videos."
"Worst app ever. I wrote with some questions to support and no one answered. And regarding the app itself, the workouts are bad and same for all time. In the ads were showed some challenges. These are NO in the app itself"
"I'd give a zero star but I can't. The app is misleading and I specifically asked for gym workouts and got in home workouts instead. I emailed support to ask for a refund and they refused and said I could get the gym workouts under the filter option. I did that, and there's literally only a couple workouts and that's it. Unbelievable they don't offer refunds but makes sense when they offer this kind of product. Extremely disappointing!!!!!"
Same thing as a free app! Do Not WASTE YOUR MONEY.
"This is a FAKE app, I NEED MY MONEY BACK, the plan are not customized as they said, the value is below any free app here in the store, AGAIN I NEED MY MONEY BACK The deal to have a meal plan according to my choices that you offered me, and to make my training in gym, BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE OPPOSITE, SO BASICALLY ""THIS IS CHEETING"" ............ Update: I just received my REFUND 😁, without their policy, don't give up on sending emails to them till they refund your money."
"Just a selection of videos, no actual progressive workout plan to reach a certain goal. There are free apps that are much more well thought out than this. Has some bugs too with the voice over, notifications, etc. Doesn't worth it."
Paid for the one month program with a meal plan and then was asked to pay another $12.24 after already paying the $19.99 for the one month that was supposed to include the meal plan! In app scam.
"Waste of money. The app doesn't work well on tablets. When you go through the questionnaire, I identified that I had gym equipment yet all the exercises are floor exercises... 40$ for something I can get on YouTube for free."
"*I'm going to tell you how to get your money back, just read the whole thing.* Like many of you, I was bamboozled into buying this service only to realize it is not catered to my specific needs and that it is charging money for information that is freely and readily available on the internet. Within a few minutes of purchasing the service and opening the app, I decided that the service was not worth any money at all to me. Mainly because the food seemed to ignore my preferences and the workouts are basic ca"
"SCAM ALERT! FALSE ADVERTISING! This contains an intensive meal plan but no workout PLAN, let alone a personalized plan, as advertised. A conglomeration of videos is not a plan. There is no direction as to when to do what videos. Don't bother emailing to ask for a refund bc the refund policy is a joke, they talk in circles, then deny your request and offer unlimited version of this bad app. SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is garbage and they will not refund your money. Reporting this app."
Waste of time and money trying to cancel service
notifications stopped after dayb3
Is this a SCAM? I paid for a 6 month program and never recieved it or any response from their email
"Editing because the developer uses a canned response rather than reads reviews; DO NOT BUY THIS APP OR SERVICE 1) Irrational refund policy (Video/photo of 2 weeks of meals and 30 workouts) and they may still reject 2) The workout plan is something you can get anywhere online, generally from a more comprehensive service 3) The meal plan is specialist and you'll need to overhaul your pantry 4) All plans are tone deaf to the 24 page questionnaire you're forced to answer (Eg: Bodyweight workouts for a gym prefe"
It's a joke and the email address to get a refund is a fake
"I purchased the program and I can not use it now for 3 days. It says that it sent an access code to my email, but when I check it there is no code from them. I reached out to support on day one with no response. Not cool guys! I would like my money back!"
Doesn't include anything I selected. And now won't return my money. Do not use
"The app has potential, I reported some issues, the support team contacted me right away with fixes, I will give it a try, sure there is room for improvements but they are supportive, and take care of their costumers."
This App seems to be an absolute scam. They claim to have a refund policy but they don't seem to put into practice. Seems very unethical. The Meal plans don't seem realistic at all and the workouts are not diverse enough. There is no trial period or an opportunity to experience the app before buying. They have great User Experience till the point of purchase and once you bought you realise that it's definitely not worth the money. I hope the team looks into this and acts responsibly
BAD! BAD! BAD! This is most likely a SCAM! After asking personalised GYM questions I expected a personalised GYM routine.
"Very poor database of workouts. F.e. i want workout to gain muscles for full body using full equipment for intermediate level. And they have nothing for that set of filters. Overall they suggest 5 plans. The best one (perfect match as they say) starts with squats, thought in the quiz I mentioned that I hate (can't) squats. And I explored all that bull$hit after buying 6 months package. Don't be like me, don't spend money on smth you will not use"
Workouts are solid but the meal plan has outrageous recipes and very little effort in sticking to my likes. At no point am I trying to eat 3 salads a day trying to gain 25lbs.
"Oatmeal pancakes definitely needs some improvements. I did my first day as making them as is, they were okay. 2nd day I blended them and they were a little better. Both times they are very dense. Possible a little more honey is needed if you went with plain yogurt verses vanilla yogurt. Corn pita with veggies might need to be altered as well no one sells whole pumpkins other than for Halloween. Sweet potato might be the best substitute."
U r thieves I didn't receive my plan u took my money and didn't send me any code I will make a complaint I will not edit my review unless you give me my money back
"I thought was gonna be a plan, i paid $40 for some bs. Hoe do i get refunded"
I've never been one to review apps and services no matter how good or bad they are. Services I haven't liked or I've made a personal mistake by subscribing to have always been cordial and professional while processing refunds. This business however is the absolute opposite with their policies and mode of operation. If you're a new user please realise that you'll not be refunded even a minute after subscribing to the service. It's frankly a disheartening thing I hope happens to no one else. 0/5
"The meals in the meal plan are not anything I would eat. I don't know why they ask what foods you want included, because the meal plans don't include the ones you choose."
I'm not a chef. Don't wont to be a chef. So don't have me making dishes like I'm a chef. This app should be a free app. Not worth the buy in my opinion.
"How to unsubscribe???? And dont tell me to contact through your email because i already did , reply asap and i will not report scam"
Unless you are a Chef or you do not care about money...do not purchace this product.... No refund even when you get this snd 30mins later you realize its not for you...they will not give anything back....
"No refound!! Exercise routine is weird, and the app is wrongly organized."
Once they sent me the passcode it was a great app lots of good workout and meal plans.
Took my money didnt catering for what i wanted to achieve and for muscle building there is no gym equipment used or proper weights so that will never work and no where to ajust my plan if i need it to Also no way to unsubscribe The whole thing is a scam
Its a scam wont even let me unsubscribe definetly not finna let this continue i want to cancel my subscription asap there no unsubscribe button
Stole my money no verif code
Took my money and didn't send me personalised workouts
Took awhile to figure it out but I got it. Like the meal reminders too. Let's see how well this goes
