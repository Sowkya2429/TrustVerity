"Don't do it! Waste of money, doesn't work 90% of the time."
Amazing
"Data takes too long to update; To autostart, I have to do it multiple times..overall is an unreliable app, especially for the amount of money we pay."
Update 6/6/23-no fix for the auto start. I love my Discovery but auto start issues are souring my views on the brand and 3 years in it may be time to trade for a new brand. 3/23- The app has always been a mess. I hoped the 2022 launch of a completely new app would solve the issues. It did for a while but now seems worse than before. For the price point and no ability to auto start with a remote (like many vehicles) you expect something as simple as an app to work.
Not accurate
"Once again having to delete old review to update. There still appears to be an issue with the car unlocked reminder, basically it's not working. I've tried the usual remedy, delete app and reload, still don't work. Is it a case of if the car is over 5 years old forget it you don't care. Answers please on a postcard. Further update... it still don't work properly, are LAND Rover really serious about customer care/service but only if they can bill you for it."
The app doesn't update. It also says the car is unlocked when it isn't.
"Switched from a BMW X7 to RR Sport and loving the car. The app can be improved, but I don't have any major complaints so far. I love the option to set a target temperature for departure, which I haven't seen in any of my other cars. I can view the exact location, can start/stop, and unlock the car just fine, see if any window or door is open - which is all I care about. Will update the review if anything changes, but so far so good."
"80% of the time does not connect to vehicle, 20% does not actually turn it on."
"Doesn't record every journey, and journeys it has recorded suddenly disappear. App won't start the engine anymore. Old version was perfect."
Doesn't work
"Good service department, Phil is excellent."

Does not push notifications on Samsung s21 or pixel. Two of the most popular phones on the market. Shocking given the cost of the vehicles. Plus only 3x years support??? How does that work for a hybrid? Makes no sense? App is useless.
"It was ok, for a while, now my journeys wont update and my Rover Sport is ""always moving(driving)"" even if its parked in my garage and LOCKEDü§£ü§£üëçüèºCome on LR, do something, get this straightened out‚ÄºÔ∏è I have InControl Premium, and it still doesn't work correctly."
Cannot control climate.... Too many steps to start the vehicle
"I have to enter 2 different passwords just lock the door, not very user friendly. It's not really any use, except as a back up for forgetting your keys."
"This needs a fix shows doors boot windows open when there not,"
Please fix the download requirements every time it is used.
Ease of use and used daily
Quick and easy
"Use to work, not any more. Pin has to be changed every time if I need to use the remote function. Did ask for help, they are not interested."
Scary thought. What if the software in the car was written by the same people who wrote this app. Awful.
"When it is working it is great , but that doesn't happen very often. 9 from 10 times when you try to unlock, start engine i get error message ""An error occurred, please try again later"" Cleared cache, uninstall, reinstall, nothing changed. All permission enabled, tried on wifi, 4g etc"
"Increasingly buggy app with surprising omissions. Land Rover has now removed customer support email addresses. You now cannot send them bugs. Very poor service. Someone needs to bring in some professional QA for this app. There is a lack of transparency with Incontrol support. The remote startup to warm the car does not include turning on the heated windscreen, rear window, heated seats or steering wheel. More frequent updates and bug fixes would also be helpful."
Never updates right. My car is in my garage right now and it says it's 2 miles away. For something this expensive you pay for it should work.
The customer care response was very quick. Also the app gives very precise information. I wish they have or add keyless entry without the need of keys
"Remote features (lock/unlock etc) doesn't work at all with android v8.0 or lower. LR say update Android version but unless phone is newish that's not possible. This all worked fine, for me at least, with previous version of Remote yet when I install older version they automatically update it when I'm not looking."
Turns my car on every 10th time. Waste of money. They should have just stuck with regular key remote starts and not this phone business.
It's just okay. Hardly use it because of lack of functions. Would be much better if you could turn on seat warmers.
Excellent
Update: no response from anyone. Horrible customer service and still having issues. Is there going to be a fix in this app any time soon?!?!?!?!?!?!? I am SICK of not being to even turn on my car because you guys don't fix your app!!!!!! 0/10
"My app is stuck and shows me driving at all times. Can't communicate with the vehicle because it thinks I'm driving around. Was excited to know I could remotely start my vehicle, but it doesn't work like my car."
"I would love to give this app 5 stars, but honestly I can't. First thing - additional inControl users should be possible to add. Second (software) point - user profiles should not only be connected to additional inControl logins, but also should be connected to the seat/mirror setup. Then I could give the app 5 stars with my heart's full satisfaction. It's just software, you should be able to do this. Range Rover Evoque P300e, MY2021."
I would like to know if it is possible to upgrade my sat.nav. system.
Remote hasnt worked since update at end of Jan 2023
The app keeps logging me out every day. It's frustrating when I'm trying to remote start my car.
Does not work 95% of the time.
"Rubbish rubbish waste of money! One has to pay so much for something that doesn't work.. most of the time! The app freezes .. it logs journeys but can only access them after you have parked up. It freezes, and it's still frozen since Wednesday! There's no direct customer service contacts.. anyone can help?"
It's OK
GPS gets confused when enter District of Columbia address it seems to think the state of Washington; also tired of Opra's diet gummies commercials. That's been the most frustrating thing for me.
"I am Kenneth moton, The Crunch Master I love this app, it is convenient and I love the layout. It almost always connects and starts the car and or locks the doors."
"I mostly use the app for remote start. I gave one star for the fact that it rarely works, especially when I need to defrost before going to work. I gave one more star because when it does work, it works well."
"States vehicle asleep despite manual start as instructed. It thinks I haven't moved for a week, vehicle is used daily."
Worst app for such a luxurious vehicle!
Car got stolen. Tracked it. Recovered with no damage. Win. App would be better of guardian mode actually notified me when it should. If the app isn't running I get no notification.
Stopped working for 7 weeks not working again . Useless
Waste of time! Why can't you make a simple app that actually works?
Every time I go to use the app I have to go through the download process again it takes too long to get to starting the engine.
Why 'explore' option not for touchpro duo ?
Can't get the app to work. It won't let me log in even though I've created three different user accounts. So frustrating.
Hoping Land Rover will fix the issues after seeing all the 1 stars. For me this app is so slow like their customer service. Pull your socks up guys
This app is terrible. Doesn't even give me an option to start my vehicle!!! I have a subscription and nothing . Not sure where the remote option went to. It was just there yesterday .????
GREAT APP! BUT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE MORE FEATURES SUCH AS OPEN/ CLOSE FOR SUN ROOF. LIGHTS SWITCH ON/OFF FOR HEADLIGHTS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE IGNITION IN AND OFF TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO CONNECT THAT YOU SHOULD BE DONE IN SECONDS.. WE SONT NEED ADS IN THE APP PLEASE..
"Great when it works but for the third time this year it now won't connect to my car, when the weather is at its coldest & you really need it üò°"
Currently useless nothing is working website down emails not sending ?
SUX
The app never seems to work right. Hit or miss
"I don't usually review apps but just had to with this one. This is undoubtedly the worst designed car app I have used and its embarrassing that a company like Land Rover has even decided to release this. A new version of an application is supposed to introduce new functionality not remove it. Can I ask what clown decided it was a good idea to remove the folding seat functionality that was in the previous app? Also,?no heated seats or steering wheel addition? Why? It's absolutely baffling."
Too many steps to remote start vehicle. It would be quicker and easier to put my shoes on and manually start it. App logs out every few days and requires password to log back in at the most inconvenient times.
Why is my car always showing at no 71 and not where it actually is at 63. It takes far to long to connect to the car!
"The app is terrible, it never updates in real time the location of my car and lists old journeys not present ones"
"There should be no charge for this app. 10$/mo is ludicrous. This should have been included in the price of the vehicle for the life of the vehicle. It has told you to download the app each time you use it for over a year. Poor oversight. Too bad. It makes you wonder. Now, no diesel? All of this has me looking around."
Good
Great
Horrible App! I would expect a WHOLE lot more from Land Rover! I owned a Ford a few years back and their app FAR surpasses this! Get it together LR! We pay way too much to own your vehicles to have such a horrible remote app! Very disappointed!
Horrible app can't even log in after 20 tries all with in 2 weeks of purchasing vehicle
Can't track location of vehicle at all times. I can my BMW in realtime.
I've had no issues with this app. I love the features to remotely start the car and locate it from your phone. 10 stars in my opinion.
Garbage Just says vehicle asleep. Land rover are just blaming 3rd party app and told me to go to local dealer...
There is a bug or software issue in this app. I have 2019 velar. Timer won't reset to zero once you have gotten back into car or even after shutting it off. Air vents will stay in defrost mode when you get inside your vehicle after starting your car through this app. My feet are frozen during cold days because it won't change to desired air flow settings. I hope landrover fixes this issue.
This app has gone badly downhill. The journeys are shown in a incomprehensible order. There is no longer a 'find my car' Very disappointing.
Very easy
Unable to find ap without going to play store
Glitches at times
I used this app and it stops the car starting. I was able to replicate several times but no way to contact land rover to let them know. Turned up to a land rover experience day in. Nissan Duke as app blocked car from starting!
"It only remote starts my car 5 -10 percent of the time. Rest of the times , it keeps on keeps on reconnecting to my car without any success."
It is not Accure. Very slow refreshing the page. My car left California yesterdand doesn't show the right location.
App not working! It was working great up until recently. Vehicle states I'm driving when I'm not and I am unable to remote start my vehicle in these winter days
"I love my vehicle absolutely hate this app, it's the worst it only works half the time, only good thing about it is finding your vehicle on the map outside a busy parking lot, the remote start barely works, it's extremely frustrating, just have the app and on the fob a remote start, it's brutal"
"For an app the require an annual payment it SUCKS!!!! It's constantly crashing, the remote starts constantly fails. Today it took me 7minutes to get it it start (what's the point of having the engine start in advance to save you time etc, if you're going to be wasting that time in the app). EPIC FAIL!"
"Poorly written app, not worth the money. I can only see Range and Security ( if the car is unlocked). What about the start feature??"
Garbage.
Never works it won't start my car or lock or unlock doors
Used to be able to fold seats before from the app and now the app took that feature away
"This new upgrade is a joke. I am never able to use the start for the vehicle. Everytime I try, I get the Download screen, have to go thru that then Open, then it wont recognize password. Waste of 119.00."
"Hasn't updated in 5 days, sort it out, paying subscription for this service"
Location service is rubbish and rarely works
"Since updating, remote starting no longer works, just when it's actually needed due to cold weather"
This app is just as bad as the car itself.
"The app is trash. Everything everyone else has listed is true. It was $120 for the annual subscription to be able to control the car via the app and it's VERY sometimey. I wish I could get my money back because the app is severely lacking! I was trying to refrain from posting a negative review, but everyone should be informed to not waste their money. The look of the app had more effort put into it than the functionality of the app. TRASH, TRASH, TRASH!!!!! Or should I say ""rubbish""!"
Takes a while to start your car. Also went on vacation return forgot where I parked my car went on app to locate car it said car was idle for to long so they disable the remote control until I start the car. I was like really that was no help.
"Forced to upgrade to this app, not a patch on the original. It no longer shows me my where my car is on the app any more, but every time you enter the app you get directed hereüëé!!."
Does what it says
Was all ok but for some reason now the app isn't showing a map with my vehicle location any longer. I've tried to reinstall app but still not working. I'm subscribed to all options too....
Did not find this as good as previous app which was very good for me as one of the older generation.
Simply horrendous experience. It took several attempts to renew subscription and unbelievable wasted time. Certainly pleased that the car is far superior to the App. Finally the effort and energy to get to Actually speak to someone was simply not acceptable.
Sign in is always an issue
Useless!!
This application rarely works and it's gross that we have to pay for it every year.
Autostart doesn't work on this app
"Completely useless registration process, 21st century and u guys are still unable to get the data from previously filled form"
When it comes to configuring the apps to link with your Land Rover car it is simple and easy to do. Navigating through the apps is easy to learn. However if you are short one FOB you cannot use this apps to be a substitute! Also I discovered I cannot register additional users! I have tried to get tech support help on this issue but I am still waiting.
"""Contacting vehicle"" takes forever and rarely works"
Wow
"It is rubbish don't bother downloading. I know if my car is locked, where I have been and how much fuel is in it and this is about the only functionality the app has. As I understand it any useful functions entail you being milked for a ""subscription"" . Funny I thought when I have bought and paid for my car I should be able to use all its features, but it appears not."
Everytime I open the app it asks Mr to download again. I've Uninstaller and reinstalled several times to no avail. It also doesn't let me control the temp. I will set it to a certain temp on the app but when I get in the truck the heat doesn't come on until I press the brake. VERY FRUSTRATING!
Useless!!
Excellent.
remote start is like a lottery works once out of 10 tries
After 6yrs this ap should be oustanding. Yet it is glitchy and inaccurate. Up Grade It!!!
It was easier before
"Used the app to lock my car. Couldn't unlock, what a waste of time this app is. Landover assist can't override it"
Useless. Was working fine then since having to up date the app its showing my old car on the system ????
3 weeks working with their customer service team on vehicle I purchased and have yet to be able to remote start my car.
Junk. Cannot even register.
Sucks!!!!!
Nothing works
"Ideal for that moment when you have that ""Did I lock the car"" thought and its pouring down.."
"Absolute worst car app I have used. Unreal that they charge you for it. Takes forever to load, only works half the time and can't remote start without it."
My vehicle lock reminder stopped working and my fuel range page is gone with this new update. Otherwise everything else works just fine. Can you please fix this with the next update?
"Very slow, takes way to long to start car!"
"Its a pain. have to constantly sign back in , whats the point of fingerprint authentication if i have to use password every other day."
Is ok
"This app is the most expensive waste of money I've made by far! The price of the cars one would assume you should successfully be able to start the vehicle, wrong! Since LR can't seem to figure out how to correct this failure, they should make the vehicles capable to install after market remotes. Their attempt to be exclusive, set them apart from all others in the most negative way imaginable. Planned on upgrading to the new electric model, but definitely not... they can't get simple correct"
Since I've changed to this new app that it does not work is absolute rubbish
"I can't believe I have to pay to remote start a car I own. This app very rarely works. It constantly tells me that the vehicle is being driven, when it is sitting in the driveway. When it does show that it's not being driven, it still doesn't start the car 90% of the time. The 10% of the time it does let me start the car, it says an error occurred and couldn't start the car, even though it did in fact start the car. I don't think it will help locate the car if stolen either. How could it? It has"
Garbage. üóë. Lucky if remote start works 5% of the time.
"The app is definitely more reliable than it used to be. One huge request is if they would eliminate the ""Please Note"" pop up warning each time you attempt to complete any remote actions in the app. There should be an option to permanently acknowledge the message. The Journeys feature is awesome for completing expense reports. Lastly it would be amazing if they integrated with Google Assistant to remote start your vehicle on cold days like several other brands have."
Since updated car seems to be asleep and does not wake up
Very buggy app. Sometimes suddenly doesn't update the status of the car for 2 3 days. Sometimes shows wrong information which makes you worried and have to go and check on the car. Random errors.
Totally unreliable. It rarely updates location and status on demand.
Nothing works on this. Save your time and frustration
"Each time u use, you must download the app again. Buggy..slow response. Basically, it's a failure of an app"
I application never works.
This app is EXTREMELY bad. It never works. IF you're able to start your engine it doesn't always show that the engine is running. But the biggest issue is that it is hit or miss on you actually being able to start your vehicle. I've used this app on two different vehicles and experience the same thing on both trucks. This is very disappointing to say the least.
No Intelligent Seat Fold!!
"Does what it says, no more, no less."
Awful just stopped working after 2 + years landrover hopeless say take to dealer to sort . Will not bother just do without . Again do not purchase a land rover aftercare and second fix in vehicles terrible for high price paid . Never again!!!
"The upgrade is rubbish. Firstly every time I go to open it I am invited to download it AGAIN! Secondly the journeys aren't set out completely chronologically. Considering this app is paid for I expect far better. If it does not improve in the next 2 months, I will not renew my subscription."
Awesome
Good
Slow. Doesn't work on a watch.
App picks up old data and refuses to update current data. I've Uninstalled the app and have so moved on. I'm done
"Status UNLOCKED Doors OPEN No, it's locked with Guardian mode on. Journey data seems to be OK. Would be 5* if the security data was correct instantly but seems to take hours for the correct status to be updated, so the only way to be sure is to go and physically look at the car. It reports incorrectly most of the time, I'm beginning to think that it's not fit for purpose. Now it's telling me that the car may be stolen, no it's not, it's on the drive. Seems to be no way of clearing this message."
Worst app ever remote climate doesn't work keeps saying Windows not closed
"ever since the last app update, everytime i go to use this app, it forces me to sign out and sign back in. i just want to use remote start but if this is what i have to do every day then cancel my subscript and refund my money."
"It sucks horribly! When I open the app it tells me to download the app, the When I am able to sign in, it tells me to sign out to authenticate, it does this every time, 116 bucks for nothing"
"Hasn't worked since I bought the app.ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è worked great when I had the Interductory app from land rover, when I purchased it after that expired has not worked since.üò†"
This app update is rubbish
Very handy
"Shows weekly journeys, speeds. Acts as a tracker. Alerts phone if alarmed or unlocked. Can lock remotely. Very good."
"The old app was easier to use and I now can't start the car because it thinks the windows are open and the,re not. The link just takes you to the manual which tells how to raise the windows which after 7 years I know how to do."
Cannot log in !!!!
It asks me to download the app every time I use the app. Very inconvenient
Will not allow me to reset my password. Keeps locking me out
"The app signed me out of my account and will not allow me to reset my password. I keep getting the email to reset however, the process continues to repeat itself. Contacted tech support and so far (over a month) can't figure it out. I cannot create a new account either."
"Utter rubbish . Not been working since I bought the 2 years subscription. Been in touch with land rover. They sent new software to my car to download, bit still not working, asked for a refund to be told my 14 day cooling off period had elapsed, do I paid ¬£58 for something that doesn't work is ok . I don't think so"
"Too slow to activate, especially after renewal. 24 hrs?"
App keeps hanging and always prompting unable to sync
CAn't install on my new Tag Heuer watch. Needs a new update
Accessing remote features is great. Sometimes have to update by swiping in the app to have it communicate back to the car to current status. Journeys with all of the locations has always been extremely accurate and nice to see vehicle history.
This new app now cannot find where your Landover is parked (useless) bring back the old app
location Now working
"I turned off guardian alert, because the alerts were coming in late. Now that guardian alert is off, the app is still sending me alerts from Sept 14th. The auto start doesn't work. The app only updates every 12hrs it seems. So I'm not finding out my door was left unlocked, until 12hrs later!!!! Everything worked fine during the trial period. All of a sudden I pay for the 1yr subscription and now NOTHING works. For a luxury vehicle, all this money we pay, this app is embarrassing!!"
My remote app has now been stuck in sleep mode for over a week. Its also stating that the other parts of the app are unavailable because I'm driving. Had no issue untill now. No idea how to reset it
Great app works well. Very handy.
Great
It doesn't hardly ever update anymore so it won't work and gives false and inaccurate information freaking you out about your vehicle
"NO STARS Wont even let me create an account keeps telling me to log in but when i do it doesnt recognise email have to start over again, tried uninstalling and re installed but still doesnt work so cant use this feature now!! My rating is 5 thumbs down!"
Since update the app isn't useful. I've been driving for 24 hours now as per app üôÑ I requested a refund and got it.
"Worked without issues now it's useless. Shame it costs real money to have the more sophisticated options. Too expensive so I stuck with restrictive elements of the app. Now always showing car unlocked, updates infrequently. Now useless. The link sent by LR sends me to a 404 page. Utter shambles and a con"
Problem with app. Keeps telling me to download new version after i already did. Annoying.
Rubish does not work since update
"Looks nice, great when it works, not as stable as it could be - sometimes it'll tell you your car is unlocked when it's not etc"
Keeps asking me to download latest app all the time and I already have! App is not user friendly at all. It is confusing!
"As per most of the reviews, it simply doesn't work. Very frustrated that I was foolish enough to renew a subscription and it's simply a waste of money. No updates on fuel, location etc. now for the last 3 days despite the fact that the car has travelled 500miles!"
Doesnt download
Just easey to use
"Was great, now doesn't do anything. Very disappointed"
"Nightmare to register, won't take password, bounces you around and makes you start registration over. The waiver of liability contract document is forever long and takes several minutes just to scroll through to accept. Trust your customers much? Pay a hundred grand for a vehicle and get this? Terrible. Hassle and headache not worth it, I'll turn on my AC the old fashioned way."
Excellent
It doesn't work I'm so disappointed after paying 60k for the car the app to remote start doesn't work üò°üò°üò°
Spot on
Useless cars expensive. App rubbish. Have new p300 do not set timing for economy 7. Use a timer on your charging. Land rover you should be ashamed.
"Tells me I'm driving when the car is parked for days, doesn't update mileage for weeks, doesn't show when the vehicle is locked or unlocked because it's ""driving"". Also showed the vehicle in the US when parked at home in Canada. Absolutely worthless app."
"I've been forced to upgrade to this version which is a load of rubbish. Every time I click on the app it tells me to download the new version. The car has been parked overnight on my driveway and this morning the status is ""Driving"" I can not check if the doors are locked. I cannot remote access the vehicle. The last journey recorded is the last journey. So it is updated to know that I am not still driving. The older version app was great for me. How can I revert to that paid version?"
Not always accurate and it lacks ability to show tire pressure.
"Erratic at best. Was mis sold this App. Like quite a few things Land Rover, expensive and not great. My advice, DONT BUY INCONTROL, as you won't be. Still, it helped me make up my mind to sell the car. New vehicle will NOT BE a Land Rover. A shame as it could be a great car, but mine is not."
"Purchased a Velar in April. Got the subscription 2 days after the purchase and still can't use the app. Called LRJ and was told I needed an update. Well after several updates and even having the telematic module replaced, I still can't use the app. Call LRJ back and was told a tech would reach out in a week? A week? I paid a hefty price tag for a car and can't even remote start it. Asked for a refund and was told they can't do that. It's ridiculous."
Always opens up asking to download and when clicked it goes to app shop and then you click open. Real odd app.
Good
"Used twice and failed. It states seemless and secure. It's neither and about as reliable as your vehicles. Still doesn't work. No updates to fix it. UPDATE: Have e-mailed you several times with no response. Premium price cars with poundshop quality. JLR, you are an absolute disgrace. This is a piad for subscription upgrade for the car. SORT IT OUT"
A wonderful upgrade compared to the old app
"UI is better, but connectivity for start is iffy on an android"
Really enjoyed
This app is useless will not show location of car.
New app will not let you sign in
"Expensive car, modern day luxury but you can't have multiple incontrol subscriptions to the same vehicle. So now the household shares the same username and passwords just to use the remote. What are JLR thinking? Who decided this was a sane use case? They should be fired. The Ford app is way better"
"The app is currently useless to me! It only updates location and journey's weekly. Meaning I can see where the vehicle was 7 days ago but not currently. Despite the vehicle being used everyday the app states that its asleep due to inactivity, even when sat in the car engine running. The older version used to work perfectly, this new one is not worth having. I have tried uninstalling and installing but it makes no difference!"
"App is pathetic. Won't recognize my email address as valid despite sending me emails to ""invalid"" address. So damn frustrating. Do it right or don't do it all!!"
This is not a patch on the previous system it does not work. I have just had my car stolen at 4.10 this morning the tracker people rang me this morning 4.10 this morning to inform me to confirm if the car was gone. I confirmed and rang the police after that I check my app. Nothing no info whatsoever Brian
Good
Asking for subscription payment. Unjustified. I'll update it if app continues to work after. Imagine paying subscription so you can use your radio in the car. Makes no sense to pay for something others get for free.
"The new incontrol app you are forced to upload removes all password history and if you need to reset just sends you emails asking you to insert a log in and password you clearly cannot recall, pointless"
Work super good
App only updating every 4 hours. Bit useless when I'm checking the windows are closed!
Was. Good until some nerd changed it. Now it wants you sign in every other day
Not loving this upgraded app. The old app was great and a lot more user friendly. Cannot see location of my vehicle with upgraded app.
"App tells me car is unlocked when it's not and I have to press download then open to get into app everytime,not as good as previous app"
Seems to do everything the old app did. A bit odd on location especially as LR routes knows exactly where car is. Biggest problem for me is everytime I click on app it goes to play store for new version where it decides I have the latest version and just have to touch 'open'.
"Never works, it says I have been driving for 24 hours"
This does everything I want from it
Great XI
Took dealer 2 hours to get the app up and running in the show room. App stopped 20 days later Be we worked since
Never had any issues at all
Ok
This new app is not as advanced as the previous app.
"Street names miles out, appears to give inaccurate mpg, slow to operate systems remotely and not value for money. Keeps on asking to download latest edition when already installed!!!!"
This is becoming very unreliable. In the last few weeks the app doesn't display correct location and no longer displays recent journeys Can JLR get some competent developers involved in resolving issues pse
Great
"Nothing works. The app is always wrong (says car is unlocked when it's not, doors open when they're closed etc.) Remote features never work. JLR are going to get killed in the software era."
Doesn't work on my android phone !!
I prefer the last version.
User friendly
NICE APP.
Excellent app
"I bought a Range Rover Evoque 2020 around 2 months ago and the app worked fine for 1 month and now it's not working. It hasn't been working for a month now. Nothing works on the app. It won't update anything for the car. Last update was 1 week ago. LR, you should fix this bug."
Way better!
Doesn't work at all since the last update
"Latest update fails to provide vehicle location and journey no longer grouped in months, looking to revert to older version. Not an upgrade rather a degrade."
Prefer older version this one needs more work to access
Poor
I don't care for this version...why are you guys always changing/updating perfectly good apps...can't you give the customer a choice to decide what we want how come we (the customer) can't decide what's best for our situation...why can't you people leave well enough alone!!!!
Cr*p doesn't work! Bring back the old app!
It is temperamental.
"Worse than the previous version, keeps asking to download new version."
Very poor. As all users of JLR apps and vehicles...crappie. Too long wiat time to connect. Poor coverage. Crappie.
"This App is fantastic all the record information fuel consumption locations visited, & grenal vehicle performance. Thank you"
Please stop updating my other remote apps to this one...this one always signs me out an i have to re login and it sucks when I want to turn the car on quickly..
Auto start barely works. No Vin or vehicle info anymore
"Always cannot connect the car!! Don't know what's problem, please update the app asap"
The previous app worked better! The location of parked vehicle is always wrong.
"After the latest update on 7/5, my velar remote start is not working. I keep getting errors about resetting windows and try again. Please fix"
"The app worked very well untill the upgrade download. Now my journeys do not update and I am unable to remotely start the vehicle, lock doors, or open windows, beep and flash etc. App keeps telling me that the vehicle is asleep. How do I wake it up?"
"This app nearly gave me a heart attack. I got a car theft alert message at past one am, then this funny app Showing my car may have been stollen in the middle of the night. I ran outside to see my car parked securely in the drive way. I have re installed this App many times thinking it will be fixed to no avail. This is frustrating. Don't know what to do now. Initially, it was car location is unknown for the last two weeks, now, it may have been stolen. God forbidüò°üò°"
Terrible app.
No problems with the app ..works flawlessly on my Blackberry KeyOne
App has not allowed access to in control screen Still has not updated and now 1 month with it not working. Demanding refund on subscription.
App has never remotely started the car.
"Have paid up until 2023, yet cannot access the app. Disappointing"
"Can't really say it's fully functional. Works after numerous trials during winter months, the remote start and works great when it's time to renew. How funny. Land Rover fix it"
"Useful when it works, but it's an oddly erratic app. On my Android tablet it suddenly decided it could no longer get the location of the car, though it still shows all the other info and sends unlocked alerts. On my Android phone it can locate the car but doesn't send unlocked alerts. The settings on both devices appear identical. Update: on the tablet it has decided it can not only locate the car but now give the name of the road our remote house is on instead of saying ""unnamed road"". Weird"
LOVE IT üëåüëç
"Updated still the same....It would be better if Land Rover removed this app than have something so poorly accurate. Shows just contacted, while driving 10 mins, as parked. If I were the CEO of LR, I'd be embarrassed by this. Do better!"
Shite doesn't connect to vehicle since update
UPDATE 7th July 22. It appears to be working okay now. Thanks JLR for fixing the bugs. Like many others it is not working correctly. My problem is the vehicle parking location is always on my drive no matter where the vehicle has gone. Everything else works OK. Please fix vehicle location ASAP.
"Updated Andriod app today, now all working OK. Including vehicle location, at the moment!"
Very good
Fantastic easy to work great app üëç
Issue of the vehicle position not showing fixed in v2.10.2 Just need the seat folding function from the old app now...
"I is not able to have a twin account for email and password! My partner and I both use the car, but do not use each others email or passwords"
"Finally I get a notification to tell me to lock the car. Brilliant just what I needed! Update: Until it's not, the App has stopped notifying me and I've left the car unlocked a couple of times now."
Not working üòï
Doesn't always work car can't be found and now it's saying update every time I click on the app go to update just saying open doing my head üò°
Vehicle could not be located after installing new app
"Like a couple of my colleagues here i also upgraded to the latest version and have also lost the vehicle location map and onto. Says my vehicle cannot be located? My subscription is due at the end of this month? has been free so far, should I renew?"
"My experience is zilch. We have sent you an email, oh no you haven't, yes I checked my spam! It was impossible to take off my old car and put my new one on, Same number. A total waste of time a day the sales man at Sytner, Northampton has given up too. So in cases of emergency should I join the AA!"
Location service doesn't work. It works ok in older versions but I'm constantly prompted to upgrade to this one. Journeys work okay so there is some location and map issue.
"I've had three Evoques and used the remote app on all cars without any issue, now today my app has stopped connecting and says can't find vehicle. Last connection was three days ago. LR support says android app is being updated, but when, this is a payment service."
"Following a recent update, on Android phones, the vehicle cannot be located. They are working on a fix. Might be good to post this, so people know."
I cannot seems to get my vehicle location all of a sudden..
App sucks...Especially for Android based devices....like others my app can no longer locate my car.
"Since the last update not able to locate my vehicle. All other parts seem to work (journeys included), it just always shows the two weeks old parked vehicle location."
"This has been working fine for the last 12 months. But in the last two weeks the app cannot see the location. All the journeys are recording and everything else seems to work. It works fine on my wife's Apple phone, shows location and everything. I downloaded the version 1 app and it shows the location on that, so I'll use that for now. LR please sort this out. I can see from other comments that I am no alone with problem."
Like many others the app has stopped reporting vehicle location. Old version works fine so nothing to do with the car. Hopefully update released shortly. other functions work fine.
Load of rubbish. Car cannot be located when this has to be one of the main features of the app. Previous version worked !!!
"Been informed today that the app showing vehicle not found is a software issue for Android phones and will be resolved by 18:00hrs today 30th June 2022. So far no update and same problem still. Prior to last week app has been pretty accurate apart from the location being a bit hit and miss when parked. Update.... Still not working 2nd July 2022. 4th July 2022, still no new version, app still not working, why do jlr customer service BS people?"
As every body has complained about the app does give vehicle location. Again a disappointment. Contacted for help and once again customer service hopeless
Was working great since latest update now it doesn't tell me what the cars location is and warn me if the vehicle has been left unlocked or a window left open...
App dosen't display where the vechis parked. Despite recording journey details correctly.
New App is Rubbish. Thinks my car is 300 miles away and has missed a weeks worth of journeys. Also thinks the boot is open.
Latest version broke the location function. Seems many others are experiencing the same issue. Otherwise decent app with some nice features
LOVE IT
Good app when it works but location has stopped working since update... cars just had it's software updated twice so not the car at fault. Journey is correct. So the app knows where the car is.
Because it is not taking the sign in
Doesn't pick up the location of my vehicle. Pointless app.
"Can't rate this app, it doesn't recognize my password from the moment I created the account and will not provide the correct link to reset it. But for this issue alone it deserves one star."
Vehicle location stopped working shortly after installation. This updated app is not as reliable as the one that it is replacing. Do not stop supporting the previous version until this one actually works
"Since the update not able to locate my vehicle. All other parts seem to work, just will not show the vehicle location. The old app,soon to be discontinued, still shows it all including the vehicle location. Software for the vehicle all on the latest available. Disappointed."
On Balance good . Similar Car location issues to several other users ( records trips ok) contacted JLR Tech support an update is imminent! Keep your eye on app update availability
First class
"Upgraded to this latest app. Seems ok so far, but disappointed that vehicle location doesn't seem to work (""Unable to contact vehicle"" displayed, although state of doors, alarm status, journeys accurately shown) and milage showing zero. Have contacted support but just received generic email telling me to check for infotainment software updates. It's a 2015 Discovery so no way to do this without a trip to the dealers. Happy to give better rating if this could be resolved in future app update."
Nice app
"""Improved"" !! No. New app can't locate car as other comments here. The old app locates car no problem. Using android samsung galaxy S20 FE. Another fail by JLR IT. Just as flaky as the in-car IT. Think they need to make changes to their provider."
"The latest update no longer able to see vehicle location , can you please fix"
Mediocre at best.
It's buggy and does not always show latest or correct status but usually after some manual refresh it works again. But now since a few days car location is stuck and impossible to reset either app or in car itself..
"Installed this new updated app and deleted the old one. Now the app cannot locate my vehicle. Surely i dont need 2 apps to be able to work?!?!?!?!,"
"This is a poor app; another of those token gesture things that JLR do. Like most of their software, it has clearly been developed by someone who has never had to use it. Today, it tells me that my car is parked four miles away. It isn't. It knows that I drove 6.5 miles up the road and back a couple of hours ago, but is unable to reconcile my car being parked 4 miles away with today's journey having ended at my home! You have to pay a sub to use all the features too! The old app was better."
"The car location is showing as being parked approx 15mls away when the car is parked at home, otherwise it works OK."
New app version always has cannot locate vehicle message instead of parked location. Please send fix or update to fix bug.
This App could be very useful if it was any good but it isn't. Cannot even detect location of my car. Full of bugs but Land Rover don't seem to care about fixes.
Nearly as good as the app it replaces but fails on location.
Does not work
"This app has downgraded the functionality that allowed an owner to track their own vehicle in real time. The functionality remains available for the previous version 1.90.0. though apparently removed for 'Security' reasons, though was unable to establish what security reasons if the functionality remains in the accessible previous version."
Very accurate easy to use
"Rubbish, will not accept your password and will not let you change your password. What waste of time"
"Tolerable is about the best that can be said for this app. It used to be more reliable, but the latest version is less intuitive and looses contact with car much more often. Certainly not good value for money as part of a package with such a high value car!"
Doesn't update unless repeated attempts are made
"Great improvement on previous version, especially being able to export multiple journeys BUT is there no option to delete journeys ?"
Breaks down more than an English car!
Does not connect well
"JLR avoid at all costs. Brand new 100k vehicle has been in the repairs shop x3, one time for 4 months just for faulty key. To top it off, app connects 30% of the time. Absolute trash. Avoid this company."
Phenomenal
"This updated app does not work, the previous version always connected and gave accurate status etc. Currently the app is saying car is driving, but it's on the drive charging, to be safe I've just checked!"
not going well after 3 yrs of it crashing and kicking me out
Food app but limited to basic information.
This app is so much better in all ways compared to its predecessor. Just can't understand why it took so long.
Good info on journeys made etc
Awful
Keeps locking me out even though I use correct password
Can't even log in as no email conversation will be sent after multiple attempts. No reply from customer service either.
Stopped working on 6th June.
Works as advertised!
"Pointless, still showing the vehicle at the dealers (unlocked). Won't allow me to set up any subscriptions. No information on who to contact for help in resolving."
Excellent data
"Very good, and useful"
"Works fine,but it keeps showing low tyre pressure,can't clear it,fine on my dash,"
Compared to others.....its pants
Much better than the old version.
"Not bad when it works, a batch delete of journeys would be nice as the old app allows you to do."
"Terrible. For Such an expensive vehicle, it should have an app that at least works!!!!"
Nice improvements and easier to use
Last update saying 2 months ago. Unable to start car using remote app. My subscription wont expire not until next year. Always indicate is driving bit its parked!
Love it
"It's great. When it works, that is! On several occasions, the app has failed to connect with the vehicle, showing it as being parked / unlocked at a location last visited several days previously. No matter what I do, the app and car will not speak to each other. The latest issue has been ongoing for nearly 2 weeks. JLR are their habitually useless selves, so no luck getting them to fix it. Shame, as when it does work, it's actually fairly useful."
"Can't even get into it. Says it is sending email to verify account, but nothing ever comes through. Where do I go from here?"
Ideal for pre cooling to allow my dogs a safe chilled area
"Don't buy a Land Rover... this app needs a lot of work!! Too many errors. Says ""driving"" when parked and locked in driveway. Says ""in use"" when it is not. You have to leave your phone unlocked and open while you wait for it to start which may take multiple attempts or not work at all. It is very limited what you are able to do in the app. My base model Subaru has way more capability in the app plus, as a bonus, it works... every time! Very disappointing. Also the developers ignore communication"
very poor app. auto start never works always says an error has occurred. also says I low on coolant but when you check the car it's all ok. these issues should not happen to such a prestigious brand
Alerts when window left open or car left unlocked should be shorter then 15 mins. Maybe offer user options for length of time before they are alerted.
How came the Wear OS for Android Watches is not there anymore? We used to be able to control and start the vehicle from our watches
Why no Access To the camera With the app
Remote start rarely works :(
Frequently tells me the vehicle is unlocked when it's not. Looses contact easily and now won't connect at all. Reinstalled the app and it updated to a day ago. Been waiting for the JLR dealer to get back to me for 3 days. I am starting to think I should have bought a more expensive vehicle.
Half the time the app don't work.
This app is a joke! I have never been more Disappointed in the purchase of a new car than with my 21 Discovery.
"Good, but very limited. Not all functions available"
Poor functionality. Poor support.
Rubbish doesn't recognise my email address
"After trying to register I gave up after several attempts, life's too short."
"Since the last upgrade, I cannot schedule the preferred charging period anymore."
I keep trying to register for an account but I don't ever recieve the email to confirm it's me. I've checked my inbox and spam. Pretty useless!
User friendly
"Sat in the car on the drive one Saturday morning and within the hour allowed I was able to download the Android version, install and activate the app. It has been working great for nearly a month and I am now seriously considering committing to the subscription."
Stopped working completely after my cars software update 5 days ago.
Not alll features work
Very good
Doesn't always start when requested.
"App doesn't work says cars unlocked when it isn't can't start climate control to warm up the car keeps telling g my to try later there's an error. Very poor app needs sorting, come on L and Rover"
Terrible app. Works only 10% of the time. I can believe I have paid for this for 2 years and there has been no improvement or efforts to stabilize it. Don't pay for this its a scam!
This app is as close to worthless as you can get. It works only when all the planets align and the weather is right....other then that forget it. 99% of the time it doesn't connect. I shopped this vehicle with *remote* capability in mind.....I'd rather just have a button on the keyfob....... ...
This app is a rip off and a joke. It never works.
"Messier than its predecessor. Seems to work ok, except that dates for subscriptions are all gobblygook - ""right numbers, not necessarily in the right order"" to paraphrase a famous comedian!"
"My car does not start for climate control, please help. I have updated latest software in the car still the same problem..getting tired of writing!!"
"The app does not function (remote sessions fail) about half the time. Also, the app does not appear in my app drawer and I need to access through the Google Play store. It says something about Land Rover that, despite all the negative reviews, they haven't fixed if. It certainly diminishes my perception of the brand and the developers at Land Rover"
"App not working properly, every time I open it, it says it's 2 months ago and hasn't done anything since...... Needs sorting out"
"Plz help, I live in Michigan it's 6 inches of snow and very cold. I just purchased a 2018 Velar . I love the car I was told I had to down load the app to get auto start. Hmmmm strange but ok. I get home down load the app , and it said it was registered to another own. I call and got that previous owner removed. But now I try to set up the app it doesn't send me the email to set it up. I DNT KNOW what to do.I have 30 days to take the car back. I will if I can't have auto start."
"This app doesnt know if the car doors are open or not. Yet today was logged out and when logged in again all journeys were gone. I know is not related to this app but my VW id3, which is worth a half of my Velar, android auto works wireless and in Range Rover it doesnt. Come on Land Rover, apparently its not a rocket science."
Won't refresh consistently. Now it won't track my journeys. Great when it works tho.
It seems to work fairly well. Sometimes the circle will just keep spinning and never start thr vehicle but it mostly works.
App often doesn't accept times entered into Guardian mode.
"Scam, terrible to change app and start changing people for a basic tool to start your car remotely, charge for a hole year when you only need the app for 2 months out the year. I will never buy another Land Rover. What a way to steal money from there own customers"
"Remote climate is completely unreliable. I've tried multiple versions of the Land Rover remote app and had the car serviced for the issue with no long term fix, leaving me with no way to remote start the vehicle when it's cold out. I wish Land Rover would simply provide a remote start option in the key fob to avoid this mess of an app"
Well thought out
This app works good as it should for me. Would've been great if you can warm the steering wheel and qarm/cool the seats. Please work on that and it would be a great 5 üåü app
It's good app but be better if you could live track your car
"Not as clever as you think it is, lots of issues."
Trash app
Where have the schedules gone? Works ok on the IOS app but not on Android
Poor!
"A handy little app. Basic information , but useful."
Terrible and glitchy
"Never Works Correctly, it says vehicle is running and it isn't. When I think I started it it hasn't even started the car. It says windows are open and they aren't. Help! This app is the worst! I need something more reliable."
App works perfectly
"Just putting the remote start behind a pay wall is price gouging. Even after I paid the exorbitant price of $126.00, the app still won't recognize that I paid, so I paid for NOTHING! At this point, getting an aftermarket remote starter installed would pay for itself after the first year!"
"I love this remote start, I haven't had no issues yet.üòÅüíØüî•"
"can someone please tell me how to fix the generic error upon signing in? I have just set it up and tried signing in and it keeps saying generic error, please try again."
This app is frustratingly inaccurate especially when reporting that your car is unlocked and the windows are open when in reality it's locked up safely in the public car park where you left it. Also after unplugging the car from charging the app won't allow climate via the engine because it reports that it's still plugged in. Restarting doesn't help. When the app provides so few features it would be nice if those actually worked. First-world problems.
"Just a shocking app! Lags, hardly works and constant errors."
"Not reliable. Good when it works, but that is not very often."
Remote start DOESN'T.
The remote start feature does not work for the air conditioning please fix this issue.
This RULES! (so far) but the folks on the phone in Customer Relations couldn't walk ND through how to get to my VIN. Thank you for this!
Guardian mode works ok for a couple of days then gets stuck in the on position. Asks for pin number and fingerprint ID but still stays on. Tried sliding the button to off and resetting the date but in the end have to uninstall then reinstall app to get it unstuck.
"Perfect! Works as intended, all features work faster smoother than previous version. Use it on several vehicle, easy to switch between them. Never had any issues with this version. Using with Android several different phones, never any problems."
"Unreliable. Often I cannot contact my vehicle for no apparent reason for days. It is not the device as I have tried it on other phones etc. However after 4 or 5 days, I can connect again. Low tyre pressure...hmm no, doors open....no and also then send an alert to the theft Centre to say its possibly stolen !!! About as reliable as the infotainment system."
Need help from JLR. App was working very well until I didn't use the car for a month. Found that I had to jump start the car from that time she app keeps showing sleep mode a d to manually start the vehicle. Been few days still showing its in sleep mode. Please assist this was working amazingly until now.
App doesn't work.
It seems to work dependably and does what it is supposed to do
"Doesn't connect, even the dealership can't get it connected. Just purchased a used Evoque landmark wasn't so difficult on my BMW"
Auto start never works. Android auto rarely works. At least the car drives.
"The APP was working for a long time, now the status states the car is asleep so won't allow me to use any of the remote functions, can't start the car or set the air conditioning etc which is going to be a pain now winter is coming. I have contacted JLR with the issues a number of times but as usual have had no response, normal JLR customer service does not exist once they have your money"
"Simply doesn't work! I had the Jaguar Renote previously which worked perfectly. Now I have a Sport and this Remote does not work at all. The only thing it does is record journeys. The home screen does not work. Even trying to manually update, mine last updated 1 nonth ago! Garage cant find any readon. Its not the wifi or the bluetooth. The app is rubbish! The car is reported as unlicked when locked, driving when it is parked. Jaguar In Control works perfectly but Land Rover app is useless"
"Poor, very flaky."
I used to hate the previous version of this app but the update is a huge improvement. Coupled with LR route planner app ability to push destinations from phone to vehicle GPS makes the whole app experience feel a little more like an app associated with a premium product. Gatekeeper functionality is awesome. Gives me advance notice when gf leaves the hairdresser and is on her way home. Time to finish off that Cabernet & cigar before her return.
App seems to work well for me. Never had a an issue
Works pretty well most of the time
"This app is about as consistent as the England batting line up. 70k Land Rover with a 50p app, wish Land Rover would get a grip and update it before I delete it. I'd give it one star but the find my car works all the time."
"ASLEEP MODE..... fix the app. Why must we suffer with a poorly managed developer/app. O because they already have our money and we don't have a choice but to use this poor excuse of an app. Love my LR, hate this app(when it's magical back in sleep mode)."
Amazing this App..saftey and comfort..perfect ok
"Love this app. With this app I start my Rover remotely on hot days to allows it to cool a bit before I get in. You can set the climate (warm or cool) before starting.. It shows how much gas in the tank and the available range I can drive. Shows if my doors are locked or windows are open. If not locked I can lock them remotely. All my trips (Journeys) are recorded and it shows duration, avg speed, distance a map view and mileage for each trip. The App works perfectly on Android. I use it daily.. Forgot to me"
Its sucks it doesn't work most of the time
Have to press several times before the car will start v frustrating.
This is a horrible app! It rarely works. More than 90% of the time it says my car is being driven while it is actually sitting in my garage not even turned on. The remote start has worked twice and that's it. You'd think with the brand they'd have an adequate app but they do not. It is HORRIBLE!
Had for a year. Rarely can connect. JLR not much help. For me it was a total waste of money.
Garbage app
Can wait to us I love my truck but evil can't keep it hand üß§ off it
More often than not it does not connect with the vehicle.
Unreliable at best times. But it's the only option
It cannot contact my car it's showing the doors open and the car running and it's not.
Great app and very useful. Only complaint is that it stopped working after an update which required an uninstall and reinstall to fix.
"Some times it wouldn't open , keeps trying"
"Very poor so far, app stopped connecting to car after a week and now hasn't connected back with car for over 2 weeks. Extremely poor for a high cost premium vehicle."

Won't connect on a regular basis.
Works fine but some how the iPhone version is higher and have more option like the explore and send to car . When we will have the same on android
"Cannot access my remote features for the last 6 days, even though i signed out, and un installed and re installed the app about 5 times, its not even updated the journeys or mileage, fuel etc...worked well before the software update,"
Good to have security
"Of all of the apps that I use, this is as close as you get to a pretend application. It's simply does not work...at all. It has simply become a joke between me and my fellow range Rover owners. My son reminds me, ""Dad, it's British!"""
"Hi, tried signing in and it is saying the server is down. Please help. Thanks"
"Good when it connects (car location, cabin pre heating, EV charge status). 2 main issues; (1) if car not used for several days it goes to sleep so you can't connect - rubbish... I've got the thing plugged into my 7kW wall box why does it need to go to ""sleep"" I want it ready for cabin precondition (2) app would not connect at all recently so uninstalled, then reinstalled and back working. What's that all about ?"
Love the concept but it does not consistently work. Wish it was more reliable.
"I'm not sure how I update an existing review but after logging out and back in again the app works again (as instructed by LR). My suggestion to Landrover is if you update an app and it requires you to logout and login again then make that part of the app upgrade process, rather than the app displaying an error after the upgrade."
"Updated from 1‚òÜ to 5‚òÜ Great App, you do need to log out and back in after an update though."
Was working great but after the last update is useless.
No Longer able to connect just get a- Information Not Available Sorry we cannot retrieve your vehicle information at this time.
"To anyone who lost app connectivity from the April 2021 update, clear your cache, uninstall then reinstall the app and login to restore your access."
I can't even reset my password
Worked fine initially but has now given up. Will not connect to JLR.
"Rubbish, this was a great app, I am actually paying for it and it won't work now"
"Still a horrible app. Slow, full of glitches and need to log in continuously. Very poor."
Doesn't work all the time. showing doors unlocked but they were actually locked
"Keypad non existent when trying to enter Pin code. Uninstall reinstall, it works for a couple of months. üëé"
"Please help me! This app at one time was the cream of the crop, however, the last update has rendered it useless. I can't even interact with my vehicle anymore. Why???? Somebody please assist me and rectify this urgent issue! Is there any type of troubleshooting I could begin?"
Won't connect to my Evoque since the recent update.
"Have renewed for 2 years, now it states cant connect to car!!! Was working great. Any assistance please?"
Worked fine before ....then wouldn't at all. Now signed out / back in... all working fine again !!
"After app update, doesn't connect to my car, was told to delete the app and download again, now won't even download from the App Store üëéüëé"
App doesn't work. Says car is unlocked. It's not. Says parked miles away. It's not. What's up.
"Used to work perfectly, no longer connects to car. Now useless. Feel a bit of a mug having paid for the tracker and no longer able to access it for over a week."
"Over priced subscription, it's free on my wifes ford."
This was working ok on Android wear but has recently stopped working and is no longer in Wear store.
So far App works perfectly on 21 Defender and a Samsung Note 20 Ultra.
"The app worked well until latest upgrade, where it stopped connecting to my car. It means I have lost my journey history and screwed me claiming mileage"
Great app.user friendly
Been working perfectly after the dealer did a software update to the vehicle and I got the SIM card functional.
Server Down continuously
My app is telling me that my car is 16 miles away in the next county to where we are.... When we try to start the car it says that it is low of fuel even though there is over 300 miles worth in it ????? Not sure if I have done something wrong when setting it up
Simple app and works as expected
"Not Impressed, this app works about 20% of the time. I don't understand what the issue is since I also pay for wifi for my car. So why can it NEVER connect? You would think a luxury brand could do better."
"Just installed this App and it stating that my vehicle is parked 200 miles away from where it is! Update: it suddenly 'kicked into life' and know works perfectly. Location finder facility is useful and accurate. Remote function works too, although connection to vehicle is a little slow."
I'm really enjoying the app. One feature that would be cool is to add a Journey planner to the app. Which allow one to create trips that can then be synced with the vehicle.
"Remote start climate control not working, struggles to complete any functions that the app is designed for, yet another land rover attempt to fail"
"simple. one star only, because the departure preconditioning doesn't work."
"I brought new car on Mar 27,2021 and app isnt working since then. It says server is down and try again later. Not sure if someone is working on it or not. I am using samsung S10plus"
Great app but need to be able to action issues (like windows open) remotely. When you're a long way from the car it would be great to be able to close the windows.
Land Rover
"App wouldn't allow me to set an account, not a good start so decided not to bother."
Before you do an update can't you get release notes out to customers or at least in the app itself so users know what they need to do to get it working again. An app that was working beautifully has stopped working after update and cannot connect to car at all. Why? What do I need to do to get it talking to car again? Please explain asap.
"Totally unreliable and untrustworthy. I've stopped using this app. I am unhappy with my Evoque. I expected it to be much better, but sadly it is awfully uncomfortable & the infotainment system is extremely slow & frustrating to use. I completely dislike the current Range Rovers for these reasons. My InControl features have recently expired, so my car has now become dumb too, so it has to go ASAP! I'm looking forward to a better vehicle with fully working features. 1 star maximum..."
Everything works on the app but the the climate start. Hasn't worked since I got the Range Rover and downloaded the app. It errors out everytime. All other functions work. Things that I think need to be added is routes planning. Stupid to have a separate app for that. Would also be nice of you could turn seat heaters on too. Mostly I just want the climate start to work. Update. Took it to the dealership and they got everything fixed. There was a miss communication between the app and the vehicle
COMPLETE GARBAGE! The amount of money spent on these vehicles and the remote is COMPLETELY unreliable.
Silky smooth üëå
Fuel level is indicated as percentage but in your vehicle it is a bar level so I think the app should be the same. When you see 20% you have to work out in your head that it's a fifth of a tank full. App doesn't work consistently well on Huwawei phones.
Doesn't work
"New app. Same problems. The only update was the user interface. Still won't start my car as I'm only sitting in my house 20 feet away. Also tells me the doors are unlocked even though I just got out of it and locked them. This app has been worthless since I bought my RR Evoque in 2017. Tells me my miles, gas tank levels, and service needs spot on every single time. However the convenience factors like remote start works like maybe 10% of the time"
"Very temperamental. Remote seat fold no longer available for 2017 Discovery, why?"
Eaay to use. Make sure car is locked before trying to climate start your vehicle. I read reviews saying this was an issue. Only issue i had was it would error but this isnt an issue if the vehicle is locked.
"It worked well to start with, but when I try to connect it says the vehicle is in use, when it is on the drive. I tried uninstalling clearing cache and data but same message appearing."
Need more improvement for accuracy and connection
"Terrible, this app is really a piece of garbage. Only works half the time. For this kind of money each car should have remote start on the key.....duh"
Connection is greatly improved compared to last version. Don't seem to have the issues others are experiencing. Design works well. I like knowing that if there are no issues it doesn't bother me with info I don't need to know.
Doesn't work.
Easy to use
"Awful, actually works to start my car maybe 1 in 10 times I try. Can't lock, unlock, just times out constantly."
Doesn't work at all.
"Why does the US market version of this app not show washer fluid level, AdBlue level, and DPF state as the app does for UK market?"
Server is constantly down. What a waste. High end vehicle low end app
"On the occasions when the site isnt 'experiencing difficulties' for days on end, App wont recognise my details or let me sign in. I even set up new account again to be sure of correct details. Nothing. Very very annoying and frustrating. This has been ongoing since I purchased in October. Another flashy sales tool without substance."
"Great app, works every time. In future I'd like the ability to schedule guardian mode for every night, so I don't have to reactivate every day! Cheers!"
"App with lots of useful features such climate conditioning, phev charging start/stop, scheduling, travel history etc when it works. Sometimes the fails to connect to car. The PHEV scheduling doesn't work at all. When I tried to schedule charging many times, it either didn't charge or started charging 2-3 hours before the start time."
Love this tool
"The app does not update regularly and my status has been stuck in driving mode which disables the remote, rendering the remote useless"
Rubbish can only hold one car and if change the tough it will not accept it. Will not let me give it ZERO stars
"Been trying for the past couple weeks to use this app. All I get is a Server Down error message with no insight into when the problem will be fixed. For a luxury car, far from meeting the minimum expectations. Can we get some insight into an expected fix?????"
Much nicer than the old app. Works fine on my 20MY Range Rover
Awesome
"I have been dealing with the remote start over phone app for months. Finally after 20C infotainment update and this app update just a few days ago I can start my car anytime any day. Even current location update all the time. It's not 100% perfect but it is close. Can you please take off the ""please note"" and ""accept"" from the remote part of the application. Can we confirm it just once and be done with it? It is anointing when you have to accept it a few times every day. Thank you üëç"
"UI is great! More functions would be appreciated; send address to car, edit more settings from the app, etc... Update: remote climate uses battery even when plugged in.. Scheduled charging does not work. Remote controls should include seat heating."
Huge improvement over the old app. Update is much faster and more reliable than before. Also looks much better.
Does the job...
"Terrible- despite 2 months of customer services it doesn't link to the car from a Samsung 10+. Lost the premium features, deleted and re Installed numerous times, wiped my account and now the dealership is open it having to try and sort it Another two months on, a software update and once again the app no longer communicates with the car. Now November 10 2020 still not working after last weeks car software update i have to create an account everytime and no premium features"
It an absolute con!! They charge you few hundred pound for a service that isn't simply working. I totally understand that this is a luxury brand. But fooling people and tricking people to get their money is immoral and makes you very unattractive as a brand. Shame on you Land Rover.
Very nice app
"A big improvement over the old app. However, the vehicle mileage always shows as 0 miles. If you change the units to km it displays correctly, but reverts to 0 when you change back to miles. The fuel tank range and journey distances all display correctly in miles. If this was fixed I would give it 5*"
Im Not Giving This App My Adress
Perfect! Works like a charm. 100 times better and faster than the previous one.
"Rubbish! New update doesn't work To make matters worse I contacted the lradvice email service one month before my subscription expired for help. No solution could be found by them despite numerous mails, but they expected me to renew to continue their investigations even though there was no guarantee it would work. Poor customer service!"
Worked for a few months. Now nothing
Wow. Worth downloading if you have the older app. This one works far better and I came here in desperation as I lost the remote lock facility on the previous app. Well done. Works well. Just remember to make a note of your login details and pass code before deleting the old one.
"Terrible, sometimes says my car door or boot even bonnet is open. When it isn't. I am literally standing next to it while checking it.. This needs to be fixed asap."
Update made me lose connection to my car. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but now can't sign in. No support option either. Useless and very frustrating.
Update on 28 August 2020 killed my connection to the car. Worked very well in the previous version before the update. Now useless.
"It seems like it would be a fantastic app with all it's features. I wantes to download this app for the unlock feature it has due to I only have 1 key FOB, but unfortunately I can't get past the terms and conditions page. I've tried sever times with no avail. Love my car hate this app. I'm willing to download it again as soon as LR/RR fixes it."
"I have tried everything, but not able to get past the terms and conditions."
Very good üëç
"I tried to set up an account, but it kept telling me to read the term of conditions and other stuff, and I did, but still didn't let me, please fix this bug"
"Don't appear to have a means of telling app to contact vehicle, so if you need to check if you have locked it, you have to return to vehicle. As the app don't tell you up to date info. Only tells you info when last refreshed."
Excellent app but sometimes is slow to respond even if phone signal is good.
Love u land rover
Can't even register. Keeps saying read and accept terms and conditions.
Can not setup an account because the navigating between accepting the terms and conditions back to the registration page is broken. Once you navigate from the initial form to the terms and conditions page you can not navigate back.
This new app doesn't have Intelligent Seat Fold. I paid for this facility. Land Rover need to fix this or refund the cost of the option!
Everyone is trying and gettkng wat dknt belong to there acc
"Big fan of the new app, it appears much more reliable than the previous version on my Rover. However, I noticed that the intelligent seat fold function is missing from this new app. I only ever got it to work once on the old app, but I would like the functionality again since it was quite an expensive optional extra from the factory that has never really worked as advertised in your TV commercials."
"Huge improvement from the provou app. It logs in a lot faster and the fingerprint addition is great. It would be nice to see other features added such as: sit climate control, open&close boot/windows/panoramic roof and potentially even replace key itself."
"Works very well, improvement over previous generations."
Never Worked. Ridiculous.
"It wont let me get passed the terms and conditions and privacy checkboxes. Asks me to open and read them yet I have, and still tells me I havent. Stupid app."
"Pretty awesome app. Well worth it. Had no problems running it on android, works a treat. Nice GUI. Good piece of mind knowing where and what you car is doing when you hand it over at the airport."
only works sometimes
"An app that let's you connect with your car remotely, start the heater/air con, lock it, open the windows etc, and remind you about warnings such as washer bottle, service needed. Keep up the good work Land rover."
Works nicely on Samsung S10 5G and looks so much better than the old version. Adding route planning to app rather than a separate App would be great.
Hardly ever works. Didn't work on my old car and still doesn't on my new one despite reinstalling app on a different phone.
Great improvement from prev gen remote app. Integrating route planner to this app will complete this app.
"This and the other App stopped working for me 3 months ago, tried everything including emailing the LR team, quick enough to ask me to renew my subscription at ¬£36, only ¬£30 last year, but not quick enough to fix the issue."
"Downloaded this app on an android device as my previous v1.80.1 was not showing the correct vehicle location or the previous journeys. This app thinking it was great. I cant even login. It just comes back with an error message. Even the error button doesn't lets u navigate back to the login page. Useless! Has this app even been tested for end users?? I know being tester, your IT department (ran by TCS) based in India are useless as a concrete parachute. I'll be asking for refund as the subscription serves n"
"Would be great if it worked, 60k for a car that won't even connect to app"
Cant remotely connect to car or send feedback through app and this is the second day I'm using it
"Looks pretty, won't control climate on my 2019 sport Phev, timers missing, not exactly a premium experience"
"Doesn't seem to work, not seen my car the 8 months now?"
Connection is not as good as the old version
"Simple interface, basic features work well. Love a warm car on winter mornings!"
Very poor keeps freezing
"Journey info failed for a week or so, but suspect a backend issue as it impacted both apps. This app has a refreshed GUI and looks good, although the Journeys page is ok not great, older app displayed the info more easily and no scrolling reqd to see avg fuel consumption. Home page also fails to show car mileage, shows as 0, whereas the older app has no issues. If those issues could be fixed, then happy to give 5 stars."
Journeys not updating - no update from the team fixing the problem or indication of time scales - telephone team are fantastic but just feel the app really let's down the experience when you buy a luxury car and pay a premium for a tool like incontrol. All I wanted is to have my expectations managed. Updated 01/11 - spoke to the team so know it's not just my vehicle . Shame there isn't a alert forced to devices
Authentication issues. App does not recognise email address. Asking for login worked great for 3 weeks . Any help please
"This app doesnt have the remote seat fold that my car has, am therefore deleting and going back to the old one."
"Error on sign in, does not work"
"Interesting improvements, I'd suggest to notify users of the previous app, though!"
"This keeps throwing up an error and I am unable to sign in. Username and password correct, I can sign on to the website but the app isn't working. Can you please let me know what to do?"
I can sign into this app but then just get an error message. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times but it keeps throwing the error message. Luckily I have the old version which is fine
Old remote died now this wont open Samsung S9
"Keep throwing error , cant sign in"
A million time better than the older one. You need to let people know that the older one is no longer working and they need to switch to this one.
