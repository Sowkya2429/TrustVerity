0,Trash pls pls delete this trash app full of bots and its a rip off
1,"I like it much more than I thought I would. I was surprised how quickly I met someone who clicked. I was the one initially asking to meet, and after 2 meetings, I found someone .. and I think she likes me! The only thing I would suggest is to fill out the profile and be honest and provide photos."
2,Do not use.
3,I signed up for it and got zero response from anyone. I canceled my subscription with a zero balance. A few months later I got a bill from a debt collector saying I owe over $530.00. I have read this happening to other people as well. Even after canceling your subscription and profile eharmony will continue to charge you. Subscribers beware.
4,Too much money for very little results or options. Lots of profiles with missing pictures.
5,"Nothing happens overnight. Things take time, and you need to have the patience to find the right one."
6,"Hi Guys its an absolute scam and money rippers. Pls think 10,000 times b4 u guys join this."
7,All you will find is debt collects emails for payments.
8,Idk how apps like this aren't illegal. The app is a scam. It looks like messages aren't actually being sent to people. From what I can tell the majority of the people I send messages to aren't active accounts so they couldn't respond. Huge waste of money. The people working for eharmony should be embarrassed that they're helping go along with this scam.
9,Poor
10,This app is a scam! DO NOT sign up if you don't want to be locked in a 12-month contract!
11,"Gotta be rich to be a premium member. Any plan, expect to blow $400 minimum after taxes and fees. Ridiculously annoying to cancel a basic account. Thought there was a law recenty where we're supposed to be able to cancel an app as easily as we signed up. No explenation on premium benefits if a non premium person can communicate with you. No way of knowing if someone has a paid membership. This site sucked about 20 years ago when I beta tested it and it still sucks."
12,"Minimum 6 month subscription because 'we don't want to rush you'. Without this you can't send messages or see photos. This company is first and foremost a money making scheme, premised on exploiting peoples desire to meet a partner. Cynical. To be avoided."
13,"It's a lot of personal stuff that, if your servers were to be breached, could risk the ruin of an entire family"
14,"I am going to filing a class action lawsuit against eharmony. If anyone else has been falsely charged, repeatedly asked to cancel your account and still be charged or charged after cancelation please contact me! We will get your money back!"
15,Extremely fraud platform. Totally not good to use. Not free. It's a business. Not proper for us.
16,Absolutely a waste a money. Not very many people. Forced to subscribe for 6 months if you want to chat with people or see any pictures. Not worth it
17,"Useless in today where most matches are either not using a profile picture and if they do no one responds. Take that on top of the huge price? Welcome to hell boys. And yes, this takes into consideration tinder and other apps. They seem to all be pointless. Unless all your looking for is a piece of meat or human trash..."
18,"Does what it should for the most part, but like buttons are sometimes too prominent - occasionally I accidentally ""like"" someone or something.."
19,"I love it. I may not have had any hits at first, but that tells me that there are no scammers on here. none that I have found."
20,"6, 12, and 24 month contracts for a dating service?!?!?! Seems like Eharmony is out of touch with how dating actually works. What if somebody finds love the first week or month? You have to keep paying for a dating site you'll never use again? How stupid is that? Out of touch is the best way I could describe. I and MANY OTHERS will not be subscribing because they are obviously scamming people by forcing them into long contracts for a DATING SERVICE lol!"
21,I disliked the entire app as it was not user friendly and just had a bad feel to it. I then deleted my subscription and got a confirmation that my account was deleted and everything was done. Months go by and I get a letter from a debt collection agency about not paying my eharmony bill. They had been trying to charge me for a subscription that was deleted and I ended up having to pay again for an account that I used for less than a week. This entire company is horrible and a waste of time.
22,"Can't even contact someone via app, click on help and options and nothing. Cheap. Very few people to match with and often not even close to preferences. Biggest peeve is no photos! No verification process. You should make it mandatory to include a photo and verify it. I have dozens of matches of 'quotes' but I'm not looking to date a quote! I want to see verified visual as physical appearance is important (not Hollywood model but takes care of themselves, and a real person vs scam). Bad app"
23,"App is expensive, has very limited pool of people in my area and it terrible at pushing out notifications for nessaging. It doesnt update imidiatelly. Yes, Ive checked the settings they are on. FyI tons of profiles with no pics."
24,Chat feature is too restrictive. Was naming cities & it wouldn't let me send. Huge amounts of fake profiles with so many that only have 1 phony picture & poor grammar. No daily matches unless you ask customer service. Limited number of searchable matches per day before they start repeating & only show a few new ones the next day. Live near a major city & 80% of matches are on opposite coast. 6 month minimum subscription & too expensive to be so mediocre. Four months in & it's been trash. DNR!
25,Impossible to cancel payment.
26,"One of the worst dating app , without subscription the app is useless."
27,"I'm fine with everything else but not being able to read messages without paying an absurd amount of money? Then it's just a scam because the ""people"" you match with turn out to be bots."
28,"This app is a joke!!!! DONT USE IT!!!!!! No matter what your ripped into a 6 month commitment, that they won't let you out of even if you've met someone. Customer service sucks!!! The whole thing is a joke!!!!!! It doesn't even deserve one star!!!! Use Zoosk instead!!!!!"
29,great app
30,Terrible. Do not waste your time. They claimed I never canceled my membership and thus charged me for it. Worst dating app to pay for. You do not get anything better for paying. You are better off on any other dating app. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
31,Can't do anything unless you pay the extortionate premium membership fee not worth the download
32,"There needs to be more done to motivate users to have profile pictures. This app is way too expensive to have such poor user representation. I know all users have free will, but it's so frustrating to not see who you're addressing. Nobody is attractive in their profile notes alone."
33,DO NOT GET. They will charge you after you unsubscribe and have an auto pay feature that will still charge you without a heads up that it will be doing so. Then tell you they don't do refunds even tho you haven't been active for more than 6 months. The only way to contact I have found is by email...
34,So much irritating while creating profile. Sucks. Uninstalled
35,Very expensive service and half of my matches are profiles are without pictures. In three months I have literally chatted with one person I find attractive. I do not recommend this service.
36,"GIGANTIC WASTE OF MONEY. They clearly know they have an inferior product, because they lock you into a 6 month contract to be able to function at all in the app. Don't bother, learn from my mistakes. The filters are garbage, there are no worthwhile functions the free apps don't have, and the ""personality quiz"" is a farce. If I could delete the app without losing more money, I absolutely would."
37,"Terrible. The matches were horrific(like cartoon villain bad), many with no photos, many without subscription, so they couldn't chat even if I wanted to, many that hadn't been online for weeks. I asked for a refund in less than 24 hours of subscription, and they gave me the song and dance about the £65 personalized report; which was the multiple choice questionnaire that everyone fills out and it generates an algorithm. And it matched me with Humpty Dumpty. Not worth £65. That's for sure."
38,Very unquestionable billing practices! I've contacted the multiple times and they won't. Stop charging me please do not subscribe to e harmony!
39,Super expensive for premium benefits that aren't even worth it. I thought I canceled but for some reason they never stopped expecting monthly payment. In the end they threatened to report me to debt collectors if I didn't pay $240 up front. I paid the money but I'm still pissed. I also think it's ridiculous that you are paying to see people's faces and to send messages. That's it. The only thing that's sort of worth the money is having better selection to fit your wants.
40,Can't message anyone without premium like get out
41,I like the format but it's ridiculous you have to pay for SIX months minimum?? 🤨 and it's pretty expensive. You can't see anyone or message anyone without paying so no thank you. There should be an option for 1 month.
42,To much money
43,"Terrible app, just use Badoo save your money. You get so many likes at first but in my experience no one ever replys to you and it's so annoying. I have no idea why this app is so highly rated. Just drains your bank account. If someone messages oyu and you message back, most likely they won't respond, all the men I've seen and met were fake and the women were just bots that advertised to me. Worst dating app I've experienced. Just go use Badoo, it has a one time purchase of like 8$ and its great"
44,This app FORCES you not to be able to see the person. All faces are blurred and it makes you pay just to text a hello or anything to that person. This app is terrible for dating.
45,"This company scams people! I used it for a week, canceled it, and emailed them to cancel! But they STILL required the full 6 momth subscription money even though only a week was used. After trying to fight it they were going to contact collectors. The pool of people to date is way to small to go through this type of trouble."
46,Trashy business practices and money-grubbing sneaky contracts make this service a disgrace.
47,my biggest complaint is a lot of members never read or check ever why are they even here???
48,Collasal waste of money. Just don't.
49,They keep billing me even though I want to quit. The acounts people make are so lazy! Come on women! At least put your name in the right box 75% of what I see are job titles.
50,"Just so we are all clear, eharm was sued $2.2 million dollars for bad business practices in 2018 and settled out of court for $1.2 million. So every review you read about subscription issues is true. Canceling your account DOES NOT stop charges, they will auto renew the account unless you live in one of apparently 12 states that have taken legal action against eharm."
51,I'd give it a 0 if that was an option.
52,I find a lot of great people but I have had multiple say they didn't get notified when I sent a message.
53,"Worst of the worst. Trust me. I have used just about every popular dating app that exists, and eHarmony is the worst for sure. First of, most of the compatibility questions they ask are absurd and/or ambiguous. Next, it doesn't seem to have a large active user base. Also, and I know what I'm about to say might come off as shallow, but this app by far has the most least physically attractive people on it. Plus, the price you must pay is just ridiculous, especially for an inferior app like this."
54,"The premium upgrade was incredibly misleading. I realized the day I upgraded that it took more out of my bank account than what I realized. I canceled the service the same day I upgraded. I keep trying to reach customer service for a refund, but the customer service chat system keeps loading a blank page. I emailed them, and I still have not gotten a response even though they have a 3 day refund policy. I can't find a phone number online."
55,"Glitchy, with lengthy sign up for an app where all profiles are hidden unless you subscribe. I just deleted it as there are lots of better apps out there."
56,"It's been just an okay experience for me. I'm very pleased with the low number of catfishers and scammers I have encountered since joining. Only one, really. And his profile was deleted rather quickly. Kudos there!! It is bothersome, however, that you can't filter out guys who have no photo on their profile, which is a huge number for me, anyway."
57,Wont let me cancel my subscription..
58,I shouldn't have to go over 30 miles away to get more than four people. I live in a state with 8 million plus I will be canceling after first month not worth it. four people has to be a joke for the world's number one dating site pathetic Yes I've selected all so they'll be more people I've even up the age from my age. maybe 40-year-olds are supposed to be dating 60-year-olds is that what they want? Don't sign up I'm canceling as soon as I can They make it difficult too cancel.
59,Worst
60,Cannot unsubscribe!!!!!!!! Just keeps taking my money but when u try to stop it you go around in circles and cannot unsubscribe!!! It is a trap!!!!!
61,"NOT A CHANCE im paying for 6 months of this app. its bad enough the ""50%"" deal was 22 dollars and only available for 1 of the 6 months in the plan. no way this app is worth do not waste your money on this scam."
62,Horrible
63,Meet some one New on line talk see if your a mach👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👨‍❤️‍👨💐🌏🌎🌍🌌🌠🚀
64,"Pros: Met my first serious girlfriend on here years ago. Cons: Recently sent me a 60% coupon to rejoin. Ok can't say no to that. Now a barren wasteland. Literally no one on here. Should have figured. Dead service, wasted a couple hundred bucks. Oh well."
65,"After a few weeks in, on having my paid subscription, I've been having glitches app glitches where I message matches, and they don't appear in my matches tab. There's no in-app support, and the 3 emails I sent haven't been responded to in a few days now... I'll update this post if/when this issue gets resolved."
66,"Unbelievably $$$ cost to use their service, demands your credit card info BEFORE giving you a total cost! OUTRAGEOUS PRICE, GREEDY COMPANY! I've read online it is near impossible to get out of the subscription. IF you give that credit card information, you're stuck. You can delete your profile, but your subscription still goes endlessly on repeat until you contact them and stop it. (Oh, MUST be 14 days before it ends.) 🤣 6 months is the shortest term, but also the most costly per month."
67,Not only am I stuck on here I can't read my messages or see who smiled at me. Madenning
68,My suspensions were raised when it makes you sign up for a year. Turned out to be true! Stuck with payments now for something I don't even use. It's got to be one of the worst dating sites out there.
69,"Waste of time, not a single person in my area and every account is obviously a bot account, its also a huge cash grab."
70,"Don't get this app, waste of money."
71,Should be able to sort by compatibility score.. a lot of wasted time scrolling.
72,"A scam. Don't sign up. They charge you a monthly fee for any subscription you choose (£15 to £35). You can cancel within the first 14 days, but they instantly send you some useless generic personality report you didn't ask for as part of your premium, and now if you cancel you have to pay £65 because of that 42 page PDF file you never looked at. Dishonest company and very limited number of people using it (no surprise). Avoid like fire."
73,"Locked behind a pay wall with the most limited free features on any dating app. Which of course it's to make sure that the members are actually serious, except most aren't. Waste of time and money, use the other apps if you need to"
74,"A waste of time and money. Nothing but flowers on the wall and very few at that. Very few ,... would I renew.... NOPE. Cancel....? Probably...."
75,Two words. Cash. Grab. You can't do ANYTHING without paying a ludicrous amount of money.
76,Eharmony is scamming people out of money. The service that they provide. Then lock you into a 12 month subscription with auto update and then lock you out of your account and threaten debt collection. Once locked out of your account you can't make payments. Please do external reviews and report to your Country consumer laws.
77,Scam app! You have to pay to use any of the actual featrues or send more than 1 message and then when you do pay it costs minimum £65 even if you do cancel right awah! They claim they have a 14 day cool off period but will charge you £65 for their generic 'personality report' that they send when you do cancel. So be careful when you sign up that you definitely want this as I paid £65 for 3 hours of use when after testing the app to see if it was what was being advertised.
78,"Terrible customer support, 3 days and 2 emails - NO REPLY. I'm doing exactly what EH app says to-do...LOL EH took my Premium member money but will not answer why my profile is not visible. My accout # EHPFVMB9."
79,Over priced and has no incentive to match you Most people are free profiles that can't answer. App makes you purchase a year in advance (red flag) Doesn't do anything better than any other app Feels bad getting scammed so hard
80,"This app is totally pointless unless you get premium. You can't even give out a number or your instagram name. It is a total rip off!! Wouldn't bother. To find love...apparently, I have to be loaded."
81,In one year of being on the app I sent 40 messages to matches. Zero reciprocation. I want my money back. Eharmony was not the answer. I had such high hopes. (Sighs). Now I just want to be left alone. #ScrewEHarmony BTW they have the nerve to send me matches 6 months after I cancelled the service.
82,"Mostly good, but a couple of dodgy profiles, but that has it's own fun to be had."
83,"Really pay attention to the details. I decided to cancel, and they keep charging my account every month. HORRIBLE!! worst dating app there is."
84,"Bait and switch at its finest. The concept and match profiles are good. When it comes to messaging someone, after two messages you can't read each other's message unless you pay. Everyone's images are blurred out as well unless you pay. Clever scheme guys, I'm not falling for it. Neither should you."
85,"Don't subscribe crooks they blocked me couldn't get online and asked me to pay a yearly subscription(the subscription was for 1 month), don't make any sense I am paying for something I can't use scammers for real and now I am dealing with a debt department. Be careful don't go on it they are crooks and their features are poor compared to other dating apps"
86,I paid $240 dollars just to be ghosted and walled with no replies. Definitely not recommend for anyone.
87,All they care about is taking your money.
88,Worth Every Cent!
89,Do not buy or use completely useless. If you buy they trick you into 6 month trial for a lower price and then without asking switch you to a year long contract at double the price all the while their site sucks. Then they won't let you cancel but if you stop payment they then send it to a collection agency. They are nothing but thieves. If I could give negative stars I would. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with in my entire life. Do not use !!!!!!!
90,very good app if you are looking for a serious relationship.
91,"Too expensive, didn't have any other membership subscription options, didn't even meet anyone, a wait of time & money, even liking everyone."
92,"One of the worst dating app I've ever used, you can even see others pictures, you must pay even for this, they make you do a extremely long introduction full of non sense questions, don west your time"
93,Nice app
94,"it certainly keeps u busy! I find it interesting, fun and makes u smarter along the way. eharmony I'd agreat site!"
95,Unless you are willing to pay a minimum of £80 this app is useless. You can't set location and distance preferences without Premium Can't see other profile's pics without premium Can't reply to messages without Premium And the lowest cost offer is 12 months package upfront - which Can't be purchased in the app - you have to go online to their website to pay for it So basically as a dating app - this is trash unless you're willing to pay
96,The words on Stat in foreign language
97,Horrible
98,Not worth the money. Very few matches and you can't change your location without paying for another 6 months. Also promo codae does not work if you sign up during free trial. Hard pass.
99,No way to skip or view anyone. You spend a half hour answering all these questions and making a profile just to find out you can't do anything without a subscription. You can't see anyone's picture without subscribing. I'm very disappointed with how much time it took just to be disappointed when you're done. Absolutely horrible app. I don't recommend it at all.
100,"Eharmony is pointless, even nauseating. Same handful of mismatched women repeatedly. Extremely expensive compared to other dating sites. I thought eHarmony was the biggest and best but I don't think anyone uses it. I certainly am not going to renew. UPDATE: After reading my own review I'll say It's even worse than what I said previously, DO NOT pay for this. There is NOBODY. NO ONE. NOTHING"
101,"Although I don't write negative reviews, I have to warn you about their dishonest business practises. Their is a  reason this app only has two stars. it is horrible. You'll eventually pay them on a monthly basis, but deactivate the app quickly because it is awful."
102,I had a subscription but I canceled it a month ago and turned off auto renew but I still just got charged for some damn reason and I want a refund. It's father's day tomorrow and I was planning on taking my father somewhere but now I don't have enough to go.
103,This is the worst dating application and I advise anyone not to download and use it. They stole my money after I did the package and canceled it. The money must be returned. They only returned me £17 out of a total of £68. A failed and fraudulent application
104,"I've been using this app a week, and for the pay up front service, it's horrendous so far. I'm seeing the same 10-15 profiles and I stay in big city. I have already canceled the renewal and wouldn't recommend"
105,A very useless and fraudulent app
106,"Worse dating site ever! One, it's expensive, and two there is no way to cancel a subscription. When I tried to cancel my subscription and stop payment, they turned me over to a debt collector. They have been sued for this in the past and Save yourself the hassle and pick a different app."
107,If you register this app remember you still needed to pay the membership fees even you change your mind later. So please only choose the shorter member ship when you aren't sure you need more than 3mths on this dating site.
108,It's not worth it! Expensive and they charged for 1 years and it's not worth it for 1 month. Costumer service does nothing.
109,"This app sucks. They don't have anyone near the Sacramento area, and if they do, they are not compatible at all, have no photos, or have 2 plus kids. When you pay and then cancel, you still have to pay until the contract is up. Don't do it and waste your time like I did!"
110,"Used this app more than 6 months ago and haven't been on it since then. randomly, I received a $650 invoice for a year and they say they can't refund it."
111,con artists!!!!!! I signed up for 9.99 trial and they billed me 256.13!!!! no where to contact them so i can actually call them! emails get answered by robots and they dont know how to think for themselves and solve problems! they write from a script! this company is criminal and i will go out of my way to make it known! noone messes with me!
112,"The matching system is good. But this app blurrs out all pictures unless you pay, sorry but looks do matter, which makes it unusable without paying. While I won't be paying for a app as soon as I download it. It also doesnt allow you to delete your profile from within the app 🙃. Atleast allow an app to grow popular before you apply this terrible business models."
113,Not a great selection of single. Extremely limited selection. They charge you for multiple months. They have a bunch of married people. A bunch of people without pictures that are into alternative lifestyle asking you for three-some. This seem to be more of a hook up (tinder) site.
114,"When I try to register it says my email is already in use, but when I go back and try to login it says the email is not known"
115,Horrible the subscription form was worded badly thinking i llwas up for a 1-month membership at half price they charge me for 12 month membership 140.00 plud 9.00 In tax i noticed my mistake with in 40 minutes and contacted them and ask For their assistance to correct the problem and explained i couldnt afford to spend that kind of money all at once they refuse to work with me all i belive that why it was worded the way that it was to make it confusing I should have known if they do not publish
116,Predatory billing practice. Stay clear
117,I wish I could give them negative stars. They have attempted to charge my for their services again after turning off automatic payments in 2021! I have filed a complaint but we'll see how that goes given my previous experience. They gave me no notice and I only found out because I got an email from paypal. Be VERY VERY careful when using this service. Keep an eye on your payment methods to avoid getting charged once you've finished with their service!
118,"Stay Away! eHarmony: A Money-Stealing Nightmare eHarmony employs deceptive practices to trap users into longer subscription periods. They conveniently bury the auto-renewal feature deep within the settings, making it difficult to disable. It's a deliberate attempt to catch unsuspecting users off guard and charge them for additional months without their consent. Shameful, isn't it?"
119,SCAM. SCAM. SCAM. This is an utter scam. Stay away from this app like it's the plague. You are more likely to find love in a back alley getting mugged than on this site.
120,You can't do anything unless you pay! Very expensive!
121,Garbage scam app requires you to pay outrageous prices to do anything 1 month is almost 70$ and the next option is 500$ for 12 months theres no way a normal person is paying for this
122,"it's the most serious dating site that I've been on. they do a great job at weeding out fake profiles. only problem is the lack of available attractive women, in the range I'm searching. But I think that maybe just a problem with America and general. but I think it's a well ran sight. it's more mature than other dating sites and it just has a basic format. it's very simple and I like that, you message them or vice versa. the personality profile seems pretty good."
123,Do not pay for this app. Deceptive practices that will charge you a few hundred dollars while advertising a low monthly payment
124,"Nobody online, you can't see that until you go premium, which is 6 Months minimum, money thrown out the window."
125,Garbage got suck in with in to contract won't cancel the dating app garbage functionality poor never use them again
126,great app
127,"Biggest waste of money in a long time. It's just too expensive, extremely actually. No one uses it(I assume because the high price). So trying to match with a bunch of unactive users is pretty impossible. Don't waste your time and money it'll just leave you feeling more hopeless. I honestly want my money back as the only person that messaged me was 150 miles away. They absolutely don't offer refunds except in states that force them. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS COMPANY."
128,"So far not worked for me, and they are refusing to cancel my subscription. I think it's fake app."
129,Not a Christian app anymore
130,"2 year in and haven't find anyone. I get on everyday check messages and nothing. Maybe it's not for me maybe to someone else. I think spending money on this is way to high, I got more messages on other dating apps, and more frequently, doesn't matter how many times I change stuff in my profile, not getting no one."
131,"Very misleading! 10 million users, and only 5 matches within 30 miles?! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! Customer service is a joke too!"
132,You cannot access anything. This is a scam to get your personal data. Do not install.
133,I dont recommend this dating site. Waiste of money and hard to get off the prescription once you sign up even after the 12 months.
134,This app is completely useless if you do not buy a subscription which is a minimum of 6 months.
135,"so far so good, 👍. only been using for a week now."
136,You have trash and then this app; I rather deal with trash than what this app and its team has to offer. Professional scam artists with no motive other than to trick consumers into fixed contracts. I implore new users to read other user ratings and comments before signing up; would save you time and money.
137,"A huge waste of money. I answer all these questions and paid for 6 months. The nearby options dried up in a day. Now I just get profiles without pics, probably expired profiles, and prompts to expand my geographic region...um no."
138,Price is a 😡🤬 ripoff. 6months is the least subscription and it's +$200. RIPOFFFFF!
139,Not Hardly and Matches even with 100 miles Look in Real World
140,"An app for those with long-term intentions and the mentally mature! Leave Tinder and Field to those that have 13,000 of their best inta photos and no bio to those that like to waste time and throw away their pocket change."
141,quality matches contacts typically 100 miles out 1st dates have a history of lasting 5 to 10 years
142,I cancelled my subscription and they threatened to send me to collections. Imagine a dating app threatening to send you to collections 🤣🤣. Avoid this app at all costs.
143,Not that many people on the app. Kinda a waste of time now. Unless you select a Much Much wider area.
144,Scam. No real users on here.
145,"The more you stay single, the more these dating apps can make money, it's scams, and i even doubt people on it are actually people."
146,They have such little faith in their app that the MINIMUM you can sign up for is six months and the other options are twelve months and twenty four months. They know their app doesn't work. Don't waste your money.
147,"A scam app, trying to take your money just because they can. Wont let you unsubscribe, and you need to pay almost 300 pounds for using it. In reality, they deserve 0 🌟 Avoid, that's my only advice , totally useless"
148,"Best dating app so far, worth the expense."
149,"Too expensive! Not worth the cost. The ""science"" counts for little when half my matches didn't include pictures. Read your terms & conditions carefully. They will auto renew and upcharge you. I've had better results using free competitors. Too limited on subscription options. 6 months is the shortest option. Seems odd that a dating app would only offer long term subscription options. If the app works as intended than you wouldn't need to have a year long subscription. So disappointed."
150,"It's ok, if you don't want to be able to actually use that app like you'd think you could. To see pictures or chat with someone you need to pay. The whole reason I got this app was because it was free, or so it advertised to be. However it's not free, it's a ""pay to actually use the app to find a partner""🙁"
151,"DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO!!! THEY WILL CONTINUE TO CHARGE YOU UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR CARD!!! And the app is horrible anyway! It's SO expensive, and there are fewer options than most free apps to sort, filter, and search. Plus they match with some pointless ""scientific"" mumbo jumbo instead of relevant traits. I thought maybe I'd have better luck weeding out the ones who only want casual sex by using a paid service, but that's absolutely not the case."
152,Not worth it never a good sign when you have to pay instantly to use an app
153,"Don't use this service. The app works fine, but eHarmony itself is a scam. I bought a 6 month plan and used it for 3 months, but it kept showing me matches outside my search parameters. Seriously, nearly every ""match"" was the opposite of what I was looking for. When I ""canceled"" my subscription, the support team said I'm still getting charged for the other 3 months I'm not going to use. At $30+/month, that's over $150 wasted. Save your time, save your money, go download Tinder or Match instead."
154,"Terrible. Do not sign up. No matter how specific you make your search you still get matches outside of those parameters. It's a waste of time. You may as well just use free apps like Tinder. The customer service is horrible. DO NOT sign up for the paid account. I signed up while on a 4 day weekend. After a couple weeks, realized I don't have time to use the services, let alone spend time chatting and find time in schedules to meet up. When I reached out all I got was canned responses. Horrible."
155,"Get every type of confirmation that you set your account to non- reoccurring payments. If not they will not help you. They know that most of their emails go into your junk folder and you won't see their ""reminders."" Sent me to collections for full amount and locked my account. I DO NOT recommend this app to anyone."
156,It was a waste of time and money not a single match
157,Good
158,"Very Good, Application if you are real and want a good connection."
159,There is to many questions at the start ....
160,Forces you to pay to make the app functional. Might as well make you pay up front before wasting your time making your profile.
161,"Geared toward people looking for meaningful relationships. The personality profile and compatibility matching system are so helpful in understanding yourself--how you perceive and react to the world around you--and how your match compares to that. It's a very scientific way to quickly find people you will actually be compatible with. The help articles are also invaluable and educational, especially if you aren't naturally gifted with social intuition or relational acuity."
162,pictures are part of premium
163,"Won't let you talk or do anything without paying money, and then it tells you to go on another site to pay for it and then it asks way too much sensitive information.... I would advise to avoid this site it's too much for something so simple"
164,I have never seen so many gentlemen in the same place!
165,Can't even look at pictures without paying horrible
166,"It's one of the worst dating apps out there. The sample size is too small, and you can barely find someone close to what you are looking for. Not to mention significantly higher membership fees compared to other dating apps."
167,Why it blury the photos not happy about that please change this feature.
168,"Scam, plain and simple. Hyper expensive, worst customer support i've dealt with yet. There claim of available matches is pure false advertisement. I've truly never felt so ripped off in my life. Eharmony is the Catfishing of dating sites, nothing they tell you is true."
169,"Fake profiles and expensive. If you want to cancel your subscription, you have to email them. You cannot do it through the app or website. This is all part of their scam. If they make it difficult enough, people will put it off and then forget."
170,Another pos app that is money hungry.
171,"I have asked a few times now to have my subscription cancelled, and I am still having money taken out of my account. I wouldn't recommend eharmony at all."
172,"This app deserves a 0 but that's not a option. You wouldn't think anything could be worse than tinder, but wait, here comes eharmony.. can't do a single thing unless you pay for a premium account, which is presented as a $15 a month service, but is actually a lock in contract for hundreds of dollars. Want to cancel that because it was misleading and misrepresented? Too bad. Customer ""service"" is disgusting and quite frankly non-existent. Just don't bother with eharmony. At least tinder is free."
173,"They do not let you see pictures of other members until you subscribe.Subscription is not monthly. once you subscribed every month you have to pay and if you tell them you want to cancel, without your permission they start to take out your money for half of the year. Even in their website you can not find your right person. Suggestions are not at all close to what you need. also it is not user friendly, most of pictures you do not want to see, are always coming up in your matchs"
174,"You want a substantial financial commitment, but you wont show me if there are even ANY matches near me."
175,Can't do anything without upgrading but it doesn't even show me what it would cost.
176,"This is definitely not going to work when everything is Pay-per-View, which it keep asking you to sign up for VIP."
177,"This is by far the worst dating site you ever want to be a part of. At the beginning of the membership they make you take this totally bias test so that their ""experts"" can determine who your matches are based on your answers. The results are completely off and seem to come out of nowhere and the results are devastating and permanent, leaving you with people who are incompatible. Only a very few ""matches (6)"" that they picked out are displayed, you can't view anyone else. FIND ANOTHER SITE!"
178,Impossible to use unless you pay
179,"I hate this app. I get no responses, get emails hay check out these people send them a message, nothing I paid for the year subscription biggest regret I can't cancel it or delete my account till the year is over. This the worst experience I've had, please eharmony just end it so I can move on."
180,"Very good job with the commercials on Hulu and advertising towards women so they would be interested in the app. It's 4 or 5 times harder for men to have a girlfriend compared to women having a boyfriend. That is a fact. 2023 and the ads still aim toward women to search for men. Now you officially got my attention. I might even fund you guys instead of ""Match"" Thank you very much! Hope women take a break from their successful jobs and find a man. I will be waiting."
181,"Wow, what a terrible company. My experience with them is ongoing. I emailed to cancel my subscription using the method they say to do it. Payments kept coming out for months after, now they're threatening legal action and debt collectors for the missed payments."
182,Awful. Avoid at all costs
183,Couldn't sign in so rubbish
184,"Very good dating app, but the possible matches are limited to how the site matches you based on an initial personality profile assessment. Distance seems to be ignored when the app closes potential matches are suggested."
185,Free to setup is all if you want to message or like a pic actually use the site you have to pay I had to make a profile fully before figuring this out! Waste of time and data to even download!
186,"Update: using the Android back button on s22 exits the app, causing you to restart your search. Also, you can't see a new smile/ice breaker/msg that you send in conversations. You can only see them if the user has messaged back, Plus, this recent app update seems to have deleted many of my previous messages to people of interest. Frustrating"
187,NOT WORTH THE MONEY! I got matched with someone who does drugs all day because I said I'm not a workaholic. And they are making me keep the year subscription even though I have had no luck in 6 months. DON'T WAITS YOUR TIME!
188,You have to pay to be able to send and read more than 1 message. This is the worst dating app I've been on.
189,I've only just registered and I cannot see anything without paying for the app straight away I do not know if it's any good to use first before paying it's just another app asking for money straight away really not impressed uninstalled I am tired of dating apps just wanting money you don't want people to fall in love and meet new people I'm a genuine man looking for a partner and all you're bothered about is asking me for money not matching me with the right person I grow tiresome
190,Can only communicate with paying members. Expensive subscription with long term contract that can't be canceled.
191,"This is the worst dating app, I've ever used. Once subscribed, you need to email than to cancel and delete the once and they keep charging you every month the worst app every. DO NOT USE THIS! Star rating for this app is supposed to be in negatives."
192,eHarmony will block your account as soon as you begin to make a connection
193,Horrible experience. Barley able to get to know anyone
194,so far the algorithm has matched me up with quite a few options. I have even met someone with a lot of common interests would definitely recommend but this is not like other apps don't expect things to be instant take your time people. ALL LOVE ❤️
195,This is a despicable company. They use devious practices to imply that you're only paying for a month when you can pay for a year. And absolutely no refund unless you live in a certain states which is predatory. So I'm stuck with a year of this product I've had absolutely no true interactions. I've brought in my search to over 300 and compatibility is a joke. Do not downloads app or give money. They will take over $300 from you.
196,0 star! Don.t use it! It's a scam!
197,Horrible. The fees charged is theft. It's worded such to screw you into a year membership. Seems to be all fake profiles. Probably bots designed to keep you hopeful. If your lucky enough to find any in your area.
198,Be careful with this app the pricing info isn't very clear ? I tried this app for only 7 days and found it complete waste of time .... eHarmony have taken £65 . ( I cancelled in first 7 days of subscription) they have taken Money I cannot afford . £65 for absolutely NOTHING ! DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app it's an absolute con .
199,great app okay place to meet people but everything and everybody always has room for improvement
200,"It works, and I like the compatibility system, but like other apps it has a lot of people who are either fake or don't respond. Matches also stop coming in after a while. Overall I still kinda feel I wasted my money."
201,This app is a joke. For one they want you to pay to talk to a bunch of people your not in anyway even remotely interested in. So you can have to pay to up your premium and pay more to talk to someone that might be your caliber. Not worth the money or the time.
202,Poor quality app.
203,"This is the year 2023. Within one message to somebody. You cannot tell them you can talk to them again. You are forever wondering ""What if"" on a free plan. But if you don't delete the app right away, you're wasting other people's time even more. The BIGGEST comment I have is: How can eHarmony 100% guarantee that the person you're talking to is genuine, not baiting you, and not a fake account. All of that for over $300-600 minimum a year."
204,"Still takes out money despite canceling the subscription, total scam"
205,"not user friendly app, great personality test but technology is lacking"
206,Paid for a premium account for a year and the app was broken and couldn't even message people.
207,Lots of fakes. No one responds. Waist of time and money. Site sends fake likes to try and get you to upgrade and pay . Don't waist your time or money .
208,Been on for about a month now and got nothing for message even know I message a lot of girls but no response not sure if anybody even use this app anymore. Don't waste your money not worth signing up.
209,functionally useless without a membership. you can only filter by state for free which means your match section will be filled with people hundreds of miles away.top that off with the insane coms limitations and it's an absolute cash grab.
210,DO NOT JOIN SCAMMER SITE Eharmony supports fraudulent profiles to show more members than they actually have. They do not verify 3 day trial memberships. They allow fake profiles without verification. Here's something interesting I started reporting Scammer English in profiles all of a sudden the new Fake profiles stopped having text. I wonder how the Scammers got tipped off that their grammar was so easily spotted and to stop putting text in profiles? Looks like Eharmony is doing it!
211,"It's almost totally useless. Also, they make it difficult to unsubscribe. Don't do it !"
212,How this app has more than 1 stars I dont know. No one ever purchase this app. I paid and I have 1 or 2 profiles at most to look at within 150 miles for the last 2 months and they refuse to do a refund. Stay away from this scam of an app
213,SPAM ALERT
214,WARNING. once they have your payment information they will not stop charging your card even if there services SUCKs and refuse to cancel subscription as the fine print states 12 months contract on one month free hope. I tried to cancle my subscription before 30 free trail and they are still charging start 15 per mo th now 37 dollars
215,You can't see anyone post. You can't message anyone that you have to pay for it
216,Scammers. Their entire business model is a scam. Just look at the reviews online. An absolute disgusting company.
217,"Advertised as a free dating website but absolutely unusable without the premium option and you can't just pay for 1 or 3 months subscription, you get locked in for 12-24 months. That's just not right"
218,Never seen more greedy dating sites than this one
219,"Either there aren't a lot of people using this service or this service just doesn't provide a lot of options. I've practically had the same people in my matches category for 2 to 3 months. I don't use this service much. Update - 5.26.23 - no one really use this site. I've already cancelled the renewal, and basically paying to not use this service until the 12 months are over with. Big waste of money!!"
220,WILL NEVER RECOMMEND!They discriminate against people depending on where they live. Offered a so called free trial but only for a 12 state group OR you wont get a refund or cancel it. You're locked in even if you hate the service. it was very scary for me as a woman so many creeps contacted me and 1 didn't stop for a while. They won't cancel me and expect me to still pay $300+ even after I told them.Dont trust their algorithm it doesn't work & now they're holding me hostage & I have a sick kid.
221,"I signed to the ""free"" trial through the site. There were no good matches at all so I requested to cancel my subscription within the hour and guess what? They deducted £ 65 from my account claiming it is in their clauses. It z the worst dating site ever. Don't listen to people who are probably paid to give them reviews. They offer the worst customer service because when you contact them you get scripted answers. They give you worst matches and steal your money as well"
222,"No catfish, no hookers, no scammers! Definitely has my approval!!"
223,"The app doesn't work..and just crashes when you put your log in details in, very poor..needs to be fixed."
224,"Unfair and unsafe. You can't see who you are talking to or matching with. For everyone's safety, don't you think you should be able to see who you are talking to? I'm not going to meet anyone off this app unless I know what they look like ahead of time. This is not okay."
225,ITS RUBBISH. REPORT YOUR CARD LOST TO YOUR BANK. SO THEY CAN NOT TAKE MONEY ANYMORE THERE MEMBERSHIP INSTRUCTIONS ARE LIES
226,"so so nut ,mmmnn,m?,"
227,It's a scam
228,"After 3 days of using eharmony, if that, I requested to speak to a supervisor because I was not satisfied. I was denied. I was told I could not speak to one. Now, they are emailing me, threatening that if I don't make a payment, they will contact the credit bureaus. Terrible customer service, terrible service!"
229,"Garbage, plain and simple, company is a bunch of crooks"
230,"Absolute trash. Don't get it, they'll steal your money."
231,So just to look at profiles you are charging?
232,"Don't pay you'll want your money straight back, oh, and good luck trying to cancel it there in America and make it exceedingly difficult"
233,Deceptive pricing. Refuse to refund cancel my account. There are literally zero matches within 150 miles with a 30 year range. Customer service said to expand my filters to include people with religious beliefs that go against mine. I asked for a refund immediately after purchase (aka as soon as I found out I cannot use the app) and they refused to connect me with management. Refused to help in any way but are continuing to charge me $300+ for 6 months of services that don't do anything for me
234,"Ironically heartless company that only cares about your money. Useless unless you buy a membership and while they make it seem like they have affordable options, on the confirmation page in small print, you realize you actually have to pay more up front and the monthly payments aren't low like you thought. I reached out promptly after making this error and they couldn't care less - kept my money, will keep charging me but won't respond to me. Horrible customer service. Scam"
235,"The free version is useless. You dont get to see photos unless you pay. I get needing to paywall some features, but this is ridiculous."
236,Also couldn't find someone and now they still take money from my bank so gonna get a new bank card
237,This app is a scam and so are the people on it. I chatted with 1 person for a day and I could tell he was lying to me. The next day he said he was in the country illegally and looking for citizenship. I reported this and nothing was done. Similar scams and nothing done. I canceled and told them not to take any more money because they lie about what they provide. They just charged me again. About to file a dispute and report them. Horrible APP. Run far away from them
238,Pay wall
239,Scam. It is PAID ONLY.
240,I think the name of eHarmony should be called the big lie. I'm a mixed race woman of color over 50. After FOUR months in the greater DC area Ive received fewer than a handful of responses. This service is clearly not for the 'colorblind' and should advertise itself more accurately.
241,Expensive for the amount of connections. Don't waste your time and money on this app. If I could give this app zero stars I would.
242,"Really, I haven't really tried this app. I set up my profile to find out the pictures are blurry, so I look into getting premium. However, I went to premium, and it says 14.99 a month, not a problem. My warning to anyone is to read the terms and conditions before getting premium. It says 14.99 a month, but the agreement says 83 dollars a month for 4 months. So I'm not using this app if it's trying to scam me. If it was for $ 14.99, I would have tried and saw if the app worked or not. Oh well"
243,Couldn't login for months and then got hit with a creditor threat. I will never use this app again. Hugest waste of money. Do not sign up. I paid but I want my account deleted and I want a refund.
244,Tried signing up for a month to see what it's about and end up being charged with over $300 without it being detailed in the sign up. Don't even look at it if you don't want to pay a ridiculous price!!!!
245,A rip off scam. You can't message or see anyone unless you start a subscription which is difficult to get out of. I was charged just for filling in a personality form. I cancelled and they still took £50 from me. All the matches were over 100 miles away
246,Only 6 month subscription options and horrible location filtering.
247,"This app is a trap. The service isn't that good, and as with many of these apps, if you want to actually have a conversation you have to pay. This leads to to the other issue. Predatory subscription plans that will renew without warning. Whether it's in the terms or not, if you haven't used this app for a while, maybe because you've actually found someone or moved on to another service, you probably aren't thinking about it anymore. Then you get hit for a few hundred bucks, and they don't care."
248,Outdated. Over priced even on sale. Useless app. Don't see why you need to know my job and how much I earn!!! American garbage.
249,"User for 1 year. Smooth app. Ineffective service. About 40% of the users have one word answers in their profiles and no pics. They probably bail out once they realize the costs. Pre-matching doesn't accomplish anything. The 'matches' are the opinion of an algorithm which isn't a real match. It doesn't boost conversation, let alone a connection. Advertises monthly cost but charges you the whole year upfront. More expensive and less effective than the shallow swipe-based apps. Can't recommend."
250,"TERRIBLE you have to pay to even send a hi? I can't even stress this I tried putting my numbering the bio and they rejected me, I really guess these people are money suckered, and there scamming the lonely people, every other dating site you can message someone, and I've had more success dating on those sites than this one, matter a fact I think I lost dates cause this stupid app"
251,"Photo policy is horrible, cancelled my premium membership because of it."
252,ery accurate analysis of compatibility
253,Absolute joke and you can't get off it once you sign up. Just don't do it. Other dating sites are so much better to meet people
254,"Profile s are fake. If you pay then those profiles don't exist anymore. They write you messages as a person and then if you become a member, the real people are no that interesting and professional."
255,doesn't work for Europe
256,This site is the biggest scam around. From poor customer service to fake accounts. Very poor. They also lock you into payments for a year from the free trial without release even when you are within your rights to exit the agreement. Wish I could give ZERO STARS
257,don't pay it's not worth it
258,One Star IS one too many. I thought I was just signing up for a trial period. They assured me I was wrong!! End of matter as far as they are concerned. May have had something to do with me having just had a general anaesthetic from major surgery! Anyway It's a rotten dating app. Getting a lot of matches with guys who don't have photos.. not helpful. Found a beautiful match ACTUALLY he found me on THE BOO APP.. And we're dating it took us for him 3 days me 1 day on. Small fee to msg each other
259,Expensive and will try and charge you for next subscription year if you don't use it!
260,"I had a very bad experience after 2 days of enrollment to premium for a year; yes, they helped but still... 85 per cent of the profiles have no pictures. It feels a very creepy environment where I've you've NO IDEA who's looking at my picture or reading about me. I've never shared pictures of myself EVER, EVER. I feel very unsafe here. Very unsafe. I think the team should take measures against ghost profile and save bad experiences to their users. it's inmoral. I regret deeply paying any money."
261,Moved and can't change location. It is now 100% useless to me.
262,quality choices.
263,"The fact that we only get barely even 10 minutes of texting someone then its like ""imma block you from texting anyone unless you pay"" is majorly depressing"
264,match you well to like-minded people
265,Bad app. You have to pay to do anything. Including messaging other people.
266,"A complete money grab, you can't even send messages or view profile pictures without paying for premium."
267,Disgusting company with predatory practices. Steal money by charging canceled credit cards. My one wish in life is the owners of this company get what's coming to them and lose everything.
268,Too many requests to be a premium member. I can wait or never be with anyone rather than have to pay to talk with someone about a relationship
269,DO NOT USE THEM! SCAM! YOU CANNOT CANCEL! DECEITFUL!
270,"Wish I could move this to 0 stars. THIS IS A RIPOFF AND SCAM SITE! DO NOT USE! It is just a really subpar experience. It is extremely overpriced, the quality of matches it gives you are poor and the UI, seachablity is severely lacking. Bumble, hinge and even tinder are just way better. Do not recommend using this as it is a rip off."
271,Over priced and not enough new people.... very disappointed with eharmony at this point....
272,good apart from the price
273,"people need to put up pictures n if not interested they need to say so not just keep talking for no reason, don't stay on here if your not serious thank you"
274,Poor customer service. They do not notify before a recurring charge. Better alternatives that are only one time charges. Don't fall into their trap.
275,By far the most in reasonable and greedy people I have ever met. Please take your time and read the fine print if you accidentally make a mistake and select the wrong payment plan they don't reason with you they don't care how it affects you I haven't used it since the first day I bought it because I realized there was a mistake in the payment plan n they didn't care you don't get to take to a real person ever they say they will contact you in twenty four hours by email but never do smh
276,I think there's a bug in the messaging part of the app and website. I can't see sent messages in the messages list. I'm not allowed to mention this in my profile as a reason why I might miss any replies sent to me.
277,I told them I no longer like to use their service anymore after a few months. They say I'm in contact for 1 year and i can not cancel membership until then and told me to keep paying them monthly for one year. What a joke! DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THIS SERVICE!!!
278,Waste of time waste of money!
279,"I have tried this for a few months, and I just want to put this as plainly as possible. This is a horrible waste of money."
280,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!!! Definitely not worth the price. Either fake, abandoned or bot accounts. Led to plenty of fake good matches. I've yet to connect with anyone and I'm still locked into paying for a few months. I do not recommend at all. Waaay over priced and once they have you subscribed you are locked in, no refund."
281,Have to pay for messages.
282,DONT DO IT!!!
283,Terrible company. I received only 5 matches using a 60-mile radius that covered a population of about 2 million people. I emailed them and made changes as suggested. My search criteria was very liberal. I only got one additional match. They told me I would have to attempt a long-distance relationship. That is not an option for me. They refused to refund my money. They did not deliver the service they promised. This is a disgusting company with a horrible business practice. Shame on you eharmony
284,"*LOOK AT AND HEED THE REVIEWS* Avoid in small towns. Almost no matches even 3 towns over. They will not refund you. Anyone who's experienced this or been ripped off in any other way, like this post so that others can hopefully be warned."
285,"I'm very upset that they kicked me out of my 6 month paid subscription about 2 months too soon as well as disappointed in the selection I had. I feel like I was scammed for money to find no results. No guys that I found I wasn't interested in dating at all. What a rip-off, overhyped website."
286,FRAUD ! DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE. They will charge you for a whole year but it does not say that. It only says you are being charged one month. I requested refund 1 day after the fraud and they refused. 200 dollars they charged me. Worst dating app ever. Its all BOTS. FAKE.
287,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! Scaming website. Fake profiles which never match with you even if you pay. When you cancel your subscription, they try and contine to take more money from you. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Save your cash!"
288,"Overpriced and for old and long distance dating . When your under a free account you will notices for several likes or messages don't be fooled , eHarmony shows your account to the entire country when you are free, so it seems like a lot, once you buy and can filter, you are in for a shock , better be ready to travel, I live in a major city and within 50 miles there is 10 matches with an age rain of 25-45. BEWARE THEY WANT YOU FOR 6 MONTHS AND WANT YOUR MONEY BUT THERE ARE NO LOCAL MATCHES"
289,Good to find narcissistic and racist women. Not an app to find good women. Plus it's too expensive. If it had a monthly option that would be good.
290,Too expensive
291,Turned over to collections without ever being a member tried to sign up and they said I owed more than 4 times the membership fee and tried to ask why it was in collection then they said I wasn't but still wanted me to pay 4 times higher fees than everyone else I don't like scams
292,"Thier payment system is set up very obsurely. Buyer beware. Even if you are not benfitting from the app and properly request termination of future payments, they will deny your request. Only sign up and pay if are willing to fork over more money than what you plan to when you realize the app is not worth it."
293,This app is a scam! Incredibly expensive and offered no services. Please don't make the same mistake I made.
294,"I like eHarmony a lot, with two exceptions: 1. The terms in the compatibility analysis, and the lines on the accompanying graph, are not adequately explained, making them far too suspect to trust. 2. The complete removal of liked individuals after an arbitrary 7 days is in conflict with the business of some people's schedules and some people's shyness, especially if they are making arrangements with other likes individuals."
295,"Horrible, don't waste your money on this awful app. 2 months in haven't had one conversation, and half of the matches don't even have pictures. My profile is complete, and you can't change who you match with or who you can talk to. Please don't waste your money. Much better on other apps and cheaper."
296,"Robbery - signed up whilst having a panic attack after my 14yr marriage ended. Tried to cancel less than 12 hours later, and was charged £65 for the privilege."
297,"Absolute trash!! It's like tinder, but worse, and more expensive. Tons of fake profiles. Tons of inactive profiles. Absolute scam and waste of money. The beat part is that they are aware of the fake profiles and do nothing. Seems like they have created by the fake profiles themselves"
298,worse money I ever spent.
299,"-10 star. This is one of the most abusive and criminal dating apps ive ever used. I read the contract and it stated ""guarenteed to find love within the paid time or your money back"" I paid for 2 years during the covid lock down. I got a total of 15 matches in that time. Not a single date, all were scammers. I canceled the subscription and they charged me 5 months later for 2 years again. 2 weeks later they banned me and gave 50% of my money back only because i threatened a lawsuit. Dont use them"
300,"Worst service I've ever used, and I had to file a credit dispute... The minimum subscription will cost you $400 over a 6m period! You can only get out of the ""contract"" three days in—unless you file a credit disbute to cancel the awful service. Spent a month waiting for someone to be recommended to me, with only a few ever showing up, and had to sift through almost entirely scam accounts; I live in central TX and even set the range to max! Save yourself hundreds and please, save your time..."
301,You cannot do anything without paying.
302,"When you sign up, you are signed up for life. Ridiculous."
303,"I use this app from few months they take money from my account, because they have problem on the system I can't chat with anyone for few weeks,then they sent me Mail to pay them because they say I do plan for year (12 months) y I will pay if they have problem,they stealing my money and still send me Mail to pay ,they must send me my money back ."
304,"Tried the app twice, and nothing, the TV commercials lie to try and boost profits of course. Just stick with Bumble or tinder, save your money, you'll just feel like you'll lose it with this service and the time and effort you took to set up your profile."
305,expensive and less results. but if these results are better quality I'll change my ratings.
306,Crappiest app ever. No one talks to anyone on the app. The platform makes sure they charge you for a year whether it helps you or not. They are there to make money no matter with your relationship goals. Don't pay them. It's like you flushed your money in toilet.
307,You obviously don't want my money as you have not responded to two of my emails within your quoted time frame of 24 hours.
308,"Unless you have a lot of cash to throw in the trash don't waste your time here. These guys are money hungry. There's isn't an option to pay for just 1 month, the lowest option is 6 months and it's around $120 with the new user 50% off discount. This means that if you just want to see people's photos and test the app you'll have to drop over $100 and that's with 50% off. I have no idea how these guys manage to stay in business lol, find something else."
309,"Why is eHarmony considered a fraud? I would say that nearly 90% of the profiles never respond back. You have to answer close to 250 questions to make a profile, and then pay $240 a year to even see profile pictures. While this used to be a legitimate site it appears that it is now a scam. They also require that you give them exclusive permanent copyright privileges to everything you post, so it seems like they could be making fake profiles. I am a highly attractive engineer with all my things p"
310,The most expensive and worst dating app ever. There is no one on it because it's not worth it and will just continue getting worse.
311,"Do not download or use. I wish I did more research before I decided to sign up for these fools. They use predatory business practices to take money from hard working people just trying to find love. Finding love is hard enough without these clowns nickel and diming customers. I canceled my service, they charged me, I disputed with my bank, my bank agreed with me, eHarmony threatened me, then sent me to collections. I have reported to FTC, BBB, and disputed collections. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
312,cant get n the site most of the time
313,This app is a total scam! You can't see anyone's pictures or message people without having to pay for it!! Total bs!
314,Everyone is butt ugly 🤣
315,This app tries to differentiate itself with it's personality test. I messaged everyone suitable for me within 15 miles (and there weren't many so maybe the app is dead) and got not one response and I don't think I look like Shrek! Either the personality test is useless or people are as disengaged on this app as any other. The main problem other than the lack of users is the cost. It's incredibly expensive and even if you cancel in the first 14 days it costs you £65. Just save your money
316,I only get matches with people who want a green card into the UK. Nearly all profiles that are close by haven't even been on in over a month.
317,"they advertise a special for one month then charge you for a whole year and you do not get your money back. super expensive not that many matches, not a good site, app at all. Do not use this app or company!"
318,cool
319,"The WORST. If I could give this zero stars I would. Don't waste your time or your money. Conned into a year's payment up front with the sky wording of 'one time payment' when I thought it would only be a month at $24.99 Further disclaimer, does not work in rural areas. What a waste of money. Shameful."
320,I thought I had deleted this app only to find £238 taken from my account I still can't find it on my phone!!!!! So I go to the site on the web and try to find how to cancel my subscription and it's not so easy it's ridiculous
321,The absolute worst quality matches of any other dating app. Along with that predatory dales tactics make this an absolute waste of money and time.
322,"I signed up for the six-month thing in the app refuses to work. At first it was, people could read my messages and I was getting viewed after writing. But then after a while I noticed that my messages go on red, and I get almost no visits from the site. It's almost as if my profile is invisible and I don't know of anyone else is having this problem. When I tried to call any of the phone number is on the web that could be the eHarmony customer service number, none of them work! They all just drop"
323,"Over priced, low quality app and matches."
324,A waste of time. DON'T DOWNLOAD. 20 minutes to setup an account and answering a bunch of ridiculous questions to see a bunch of blurred out pictures. There's a lot more to complain about but you already wasted 20 minutes of my time.
325,"Just updated the app, and it immediately crashes upon trying to start it."
326,"0 out of 10. Would not recommend. I paid over $200 for a year long membership, and got one semi decent match who lived 4 hours away. Other than that, messaged a lot of people and didn't get responses the majority of the time. When my membership expired, I suddenly got another match and a couple of messages from this new person. But now the app is holding those messages hostage unless I buy another membership. It also wouldn't let me just send the match my phone number. So yeah, garbage."
327,I found the love of my life on eHarmony. Marriage is going to happen with us👍.
328,"THIS IS THE WORST DATING SITE EVER. IT DOESNT GIVE YOU ANY VIABLE MATCHES, MESSAGES DONT GO THROUGH AND ON TOP OF THAT I AM STUCK PAYING FOR THE NEXT 8 MONTHS. I AM SO SO SO SAD AND WANT TO CRY EVERY TIME I SEE THIS APP. DO NOT GET IT PLEASE."
329,Just don't.
330,Eh... if you don't pay premium you can't do much of anything...
331,Subscribed 3 months and haven't gotten a reply from anyone since 3 weeks I joined the app Very disappointed
332,It's rubbish
333,"Only join this App if you want to be stuck paying for it for a full year! They refuse to cancel subscription, you can close but still have keep Making payments for a year. Hate this App, they match you up with people that you have nothing in common with, they pick out a one thing that you both like and call it a match. Before signing up read the fine prints otherwise you'll be stuck like me....paying for something that you do not want.....R"
334,"Add showed up for 19.00 for the first month, so i was going to try the app out for a month. No total showed up at check out it just instantly processed. Later, I checked my paypal, and the bill is for 458.00 and was processing. I called and told them the mistake I made. I was then told they only do refunds in a few states so basically, i was screwed out of 450.00 with no refund policy. Ok, no refund, and you get like almost no matches on this app, probably because there's no people on it."
335,Way to many entitled women on there.. Not serious about wanting a relationship just attention. Not worth your time or money... It says deleted profiles i counted 30 in a row Theres something wrong with there soft ware
336,"Waste of time and money, this app is a scam run by pedophiles"
337,Can't see nobody message and forces me to buy the premium
338,App is made to take your money. You make a subscription and then it charges you $100 a month for possible chances of getting dates but that's it.
339,Wants money straight away!
340,"There's no way to immediately cancel. You can't just pay for 1 month or a week to try it out. If you agree to the 6, 12 or 24 months you'll be charged for all months. Honestly this app feels like a waste of time especially if you're not ready to pay for the extra/necessary access needed to actually talk to other people"
341,"I haven't enjoyed this app at all. I find much more selection, opportunity to connect on the lesser known, free, or next to free apps. Regret my purchase & membership entirely. Not at all what it once was."
342,"Borderline fraud, no pictures are visible until you pay for a subscription. Monthly subscription bills for the entire duration at once, and they give no refunds or trials. App centers around eharmony making money and nothing else."
343,"This is way too expensive for what you get. The people who are ""compatible"" matches don't make any impact on helping connect you. Not many people use this service, and I regret paying for this dating service. When I first signed up I had people talking to me, then about a month later noone says anything anymore. I have made better connections/friends with people on Tinder."
344,Not worth the money
345,The distance search is terrible but the rest of the app is pretty good
346,another match group corporation cash grab style app. blurred pics so can't see anyone which makes it pointless then can never even say hi unless u spend cash. why would their app ever work? tinder let's u click and message alllllll day for freeeeeeeee
347,Horrible!
348,I can't even change my password
349,"These people should be sued!! DO NOT USE THIS APP. The subscription is designed to lock you in a contract. If you want to cancel you will still need to pay 100's of dollars for the duration of the contract. Furthermore if you don't pay, then they send a debt collector chasing you for the money. The worst experience I had in my life. Save your time and energy and do not fall into the situation. Just a warning guys."
350,"The same rubbishas the other apps. You choose certain physical characteristics for nothing because this place is gonna show, repeatedly, the opposite you don't prefere. And this place doesn't save either from scammers. A trully waste of my money, time and hope. You know what? Go out and meet real people, ""touchable"". Good luck"
351,Useless
352,"Not many matches. Also, I wish eharmony would confirm that I actually want to send a like before sending it. I've accidently sent likes twice so far."
353,Do dont download this app. Everyone on here lives far away and all they are lookong for is ONS so you might as well use tinder for free. Garbage and a complete scam. Most profiles are fake and scammers. Don't waste your time or money!! Contacted eharmony and they don't care about wasting your hard earned money. 💯
354,Ot takes you through like 10 minutes of account set up before just throwing you into it not telling you how it works. I don't know how the icebreakers work and I can even message people without signing up for premium.
355,Very expensive and also painful to use give it a big miss if I could give this app zero or negative stars I would not hesitate to do so
356,"Can't message people, unless you pay of course. Can't see likes, unless you pay. Can't customize search features, good luck matching with someone within 200 miles of you, they'll never show up on your radar. Worst dating app."
357,awesome best site to find your one true love thanks eharmony
358,"Utterly disappointed in the selection of women on this app/site. None of the women in any of my searches match what I'm looking for, I even expanded the parameters all the way & none of the women I saw were remotely close to what I'm looking for. I gave it a chance & it is definitely NOT worth the money for a 6, 12, or 24 month subscription, I want my money back!!! I will never return to eharmony, scraping the bottom of the barrel."
359,"RUN! Do not do it. I have had FAR LESS actual dating or actual conversation on eHarmony than on free dating sites. They are charging astronomical prices for a lackluster app that has very little to offer. The platform itself it not user friendly, it's not impressive at all. For the amount of money they charged me (there is no backing out) it has offered much less than Tinder, FB dating, or plenty of fish. After 4 months of use I have nothing positive to say the app."
360,"I take back my earlier review, I just didn't give myself enough time and patience, a mistake I will never make again."
361,Convenient way to possibly meet nice men with common interests.
362,I think this is an excellent site to meet someone
363,gr8
364,"What the hell is up with all the code still being on the app instead of the actual buttons, greetings, pix, options, etc??? Its like the app is still in its initial production phase."
365,the app stopped working after update and does not load properly.
366,"Have just paid my money for this app today morning, since than have failed to log in yet they took my money ."
367,This site sucks and it's difficult to cancel
368,"Great site. If you use the enalasis part of the app ( and not just skip through the pictures, ) it will help a lot. Hope you find your soul mate."
369,"I joined the free eHarmony on my phone. I accidentally hit the subscription and within minutes tried to correct and cancel it. Rather than engage with me, eHarmony sent my details to a collection agency. I felt they were unethical in their business model. I am angry with them and would not recommend them to anyone. Zero ethics. No cooling off period in Australia and rude to deal with. Don't get it. Other dating apps are much better."
370,"Very few responses after a couple of weeks. So I decide to cancel my account/subscription. I checked my bank account today, and they took money out. Don't use this dating site it's a rip-off. So now I have to try cancel my subscription again and get my money. Wish me luck this site is nothing like they show and the commercials on TV!!!"
371,Pay to win lol
372,"Extremely overpriced. They also use inactive accounts to ""like"" your profile. Pretty much the same dating pool quality as a free dating app."
373,Remember it's nothing but fake files nothing more than a scam so they can get your money one of the reasons they will not fix it or respond they themselves are being paid so they lead you into these site full of bots 😲 scammers please be careful for all those who read this
374,"The latest update has made it even worst; eliminating the ability to know if your sent messages have been viewed/disregarded or not. I rather know the person is not interested than just wonder if they even got the message which is often the case as not many stay past trial offer days. The user base is small even in big cities and the benefits for paid users are extremely limited, definitely not worth the higher price compared to other similar apps."
375,"A free app that won't let you see one message without paying, dating is getting so expensive these days"
376,If you are a simple guy/ man who doesn't know how to take a good selfie or own pictures!! Please never pay any subscription! People are serious because they pay money but still get judged by how you look rather than who you are! Don't pay any subscription for 6 or 12 months here. Please***
377,"If you are Chinese, and the counter party uses Chinese to talk to you and ask for your phone number, do not trust the counter party. I experienced two scammers here. both talked to me in Chinese. After getting my number, one added me to whatsapp and tried to cheat me to invest in bitcoin. I blocked another, but get strange contact on mobile and whatsapp more than 10 different numbers."
378,I have had a good experience on this site.
379,"Waste, very small user base."
380,Very limited matches
381,lame
382,omg 7 8 7pppo4 .3 I cyi m .
383,"Awful app, very few people, and terrible membership policies. Do NOT give this app your money"
384,You go through a 20 minute questionnaire to sign up but will not be allowed to view even a single picture of anyone you've matched with unless you pay for premium membership. This should be made CLEAR before answering questions that feel everlasting!
385,The price isn't anything I don't mind what I don't like is it a been on it for almost 2 months and have yet to meet anybody in person or barely get messages and I chat 1st
386,Terroble app and the company lies
387,"One word, scam!"
388,"Only benefits if you have the membership. Otherwise extremely limited, it should have a flexible monthly plan option, too. Instead of not letting you chat at all to others (if you don't have the membership), it should have a limit of messages per day. Would probably have more memberships and for longer, too, as many have deleted their accounts due to restrictions."
389,"Charge way to much for theit app, AND they continue charging my bank account after canceling my subscription. Do not sign up with them!"
390,"Probably the worst dating app out there. You cant even use it without paying a stupid amount for the ""premium"". Cant even see people's photos!!!"
391,So...you have to pay for premium in order to see pictures on profiles? Biggest cash grab ever. Terrible app. Ya MF should be ashamed of yourself
392,Crashes regularly.
393,"It is a shame on these people for holding hostage for a insane amount of money to talk to people, all the whole using YOUR information and time. I thought politicians where crooked !"
394,I accidentally signed up for 6 months. I immediately wrote to you but you refused to cancel it. GOING TO AUTHORITIES.
395,"Scam, confusing ""match score"" always the same profiles even if they are far away. Everything is locked behind pay wall, no one cares about you making a connection they just want your money."
396,"WARNING ⚠️ Can't even put what you want in your profile description. ☣️ For the limited selection, it costs you your soul. 🔥 Eharmony preys on the DESPERATE, consuming your wallet $$$ Your DESCRIPTION of YOURSELF can be rejected with NO EXPLANATION. ⚠️☣️ YEAR CONTRACT to see anyone."
397,Horrible dating app it's literally a scam all because one they want you to pay for membership I can go on us dating without having to pay for membership also it's keeps refusing to log me in and it's a pain it keeps saying error can't log in with your Facebook account please try again and it keeps doing it when you sign in with your Gmail you have to go to the actual website in order to put your Gmail in because the app keeps saying oh the information you just put in is not known
398,"Eharnony makes you pay to see pics. They create bot accounts to message you. When you get a membership, the bot account is deleted. Not they stopped talking, not a real person deleted it. I watched the account delete on the second monitor as soon as I got my premium. I dojble checked on my second non premium test account. Bot is still there.If credentials matter, I'm an automaton networking expert."
399,You spend so long doing all the stuff and pay way over the odds for a smaller pool of people and the same behaviour happens. No one talks. It's a fairly poor app and the way it is run is a gimmick. Not going on again. Cancelling subscription as people don't have the gumption to even say sorry you're not for me. Can't even cancel it by yourself so it's all about keeping the money. Rip off.
