0,"I putt all my money as per Tejimandi advice and was glad on my decision. But today I am confused with the performance of their suggested stocks. Market is at all time high and Al indexes are at peak but most of the stocks in both category, either flagship or multiplier, are in selling mode. It indicates some game behind the curtains."

8,good app
9,Horrible customer support. Discount coupon not working. KYC is mandatory(???) and not easy to verify. Don't subscribe.
10,99 ka neahi hai ye
11,I am surprised to see that for doing subscriptions via net banking I dont see HDFC and SBI to select. These are 2 largest banks. How to pay as I am NRI amd dont use UPI.
12,good
13,This is scam. We want to check my portfolio is correct or not but no any options available in this app. Return back our money.
14,hi sir
15,Scam I'm not able to check my portfolio
16,Zero rating for UI and waste of time if you install this app.
17,Not Good
18,"Good going so far, I wanted to evaluate for sometime before sharing my experience, their portfolio has fetched 20% in about 6 months so far, well market has also moved positively too. Pros: Documented rationale behind each script selection. Ease of app interface, except some glitches. Cons: Subscription price difference between flagship and multiplier is not proportionate considering the ROI difference between them. need to see how their picks perform in the coming days as market is at peak"
19,target prise not provide
20,Rubbish
21,"It's a waste app Don't download this ,if you download this don't get any plan It's a scam no support no advice"

123,Don't waste your money Worst app
124,good
125,It is one of the worst app. There is no help. It is wastage of money and time. They just take money and show you portfolio of 15-16 stocks. They just give name. They never tell you entry price of target. They even don't provide contact details or link to leave a message. Please never follow this.
126,Expected return of investment I am getting. I have invested in both flagship portfolio and multiplier portfolio one time and till now in profit

134,"Login with otp everytime is irritating. Give options of password, mpin, otp to customers."
135,One of the worst experience i ever had was opening account in this mosl .Never ever try this app /account.They never helped nor they guided . Calls provided were extremely bad. They even dont know where market is heading .My opinion is they misguide only and loot retailers money always. Just beware and stay safe .
136,bahut hi gatiya app hai
137,Bakvas app
138,Absolutely no gain from this app. They just mention which stocks are good to invest. Even u can google and everyone knows those stocks. Once subscription started u will get call from call center but use. Today is my second day after subscription my personal advisor avoiding my calls.
139,Just started today
140,worthless app
141,Avg user interface. Pl give option of login with ID & Password like all other apps. Your app only has one option i.e. OTP. Give all options to user like password or mpin or OTP. It will be helpful.
142,Customer care not interested to guide
143,good analysis
144,This app is run by motilaloswal and they are biggest cheaters never invest in motilaloswal they only make money by their 3 times hidden charges there research is useless and advisors are fool they need only their brokage and never bother for your loss no one will attend your problem after you subscribe there charges are 3 time higher then any other brokers
