Nice
doesn't work
Doesn't even have capability to do what the ad said 😡
They are hackers
camera kept stopping
False. No filter to turn regular people picture into anime character picture.
Garbage
App does not open no Instructions
keeps closing
keeps crashing galaxy s20 fe
"false advertisement. I am supposed to be able to switch hair styles, but there is no hair styles to choose from"
cool
nothing like how the adds are
crashes
keeps stopping and doesn't do anything. it's fake
"Worst app ever, downloaded it and it would randomly open random sites on the internet on my phone. Don't download this trash, probably hackers or something idk, just don't download"
Terrible
"This app crashed multiple times and couldn't turn my photo into an anime version of myself, so garbage app."
"Horrible, nothing like advertisement absolute garbage overall, just another app trying to get your ad revenue Don't download"
Did not allow me to try different hairstyles.
Literally trash
This app lies about other games and doesn't even have them stop wasting your time installing this app
"Just nothing like the ad ,there is 5 beauty things and it shows you from five years :HORRIBLE APP:,don t waste your time.Like I could have been doing a good app.👎👎👎👎TERRIBLE AND HORRIBLE"
I love it
"Causes random ads to pop up when I'm not even using the ap! My entire screen would suddenly change to a chrome webpage and I didn't even have chrome open. This happened several times an hour for days. Thankfully, someone in the reviews said the same thing was happening to them, or I never would have figured it out."
Good!
Kept closing and wouldn't do anything.
I don't even know how this app was downloaded into my phone. It wasn't until I screenshot what it was doing that I saw the icon above and went looking for whatever app it was. I could be doing something on my phone and then a blue spinning circle I'd never seen would pop up and the page would freeze. It took me a while to realize it was duplicating whatever page or app I was on. Chrome would also open up every 5 mins.
Plenty bad
I would give it a 0 if I could. No direction on how to use it. Could only use a filter. Do not download
Most worst app i ve ever seen
The add I saw was so much better than what the real deal is
This app was advertised to show you different hairstyles yet that's not even an option it's beyond stupid
traivoScott
it keeps stopping
app keeps stopping
The best in the world
Complete garbage. My phone camera can do more then this. And it doesn't even do as advertised.
not even one pic before I have to pay can't even try it
I literally got a ad saying see what your future kid would look like as soon as I press it because I wanna laugh it doesn't show and it makes my phone glitch so I rate this a one because it's not a good app
False advertising
it's alright for now
Ads appear out of nowhere and don't go away. I cannot find the young-old filter anywhere. I am tired of this. Uninstalling now.
first time with this app
All adds
"DOES NOT DO AI ART!!! Falsely advertised and controls have no explanation. Even if you just wanted to adjust a photo, the controls are so confusing you could never figure it out"
"The app has false advertising about features and filters, I only downloaded it because it claimed to have an anime filter (wanted to see if it was any good for drawing references) and that was nowhere to be found once the app was open. Additionally, they're clearly buying 5 star reviews... I read through a bunch of them, and they aren't even relevant to the app."
great
Way to many ads. What is advertised is not the same in any way.
False advertising it said it can make you look like an anime character but it doesn't
automatically stopped. will try again.
Nice
Nothings happening
keeps stopping
False advertisement. Doesn't do what I seen advertised on Facebook. I should've known🙄
Adverti lng a filter that doeant exist. Annoying ads...tons of better apps out there
Ad is misleading.
Sucks
I hate this app
So they edited my photo and then kept it. Talk about a breach of privacy. Don't do it!!!!
False advertising
Good
"The entire advertising was based round being able to change yourself into an anime character but there is no option to do it. In addition, it's very laggy and slow"
Wrong
Absolute trash app. It crashes every time I select a picture and exits to my home screen
"does not do as advertised, and picture quality is bad. App keeps crashing."
no hair (changes) options which is why i installed . uninstalling
giodbjob
It is no good No features like advertisement keeps stopping
this app doesn't do what the add shows and what it does do is horrible I added a picture to edit and it made the screen black so there was no picture to edit and taking a new picture the things so faded you can barley see yourself
Worst bait-n-switch ads on this worthless app.
Does nothing. Zero stars isn't an option
Super laggy and keeps kicking me off.
"I downloaded it to check out hairstyles on a photo, but haven't opened it yet. Now ads are popping up, covering my screen. Twitter, Chrome, or even just on my phone. There's no source on the ads, no way to find out. But cause/effect. Malware scans found nothing. I expect ads when using an app that contains ads. I don't expect them to take over my screen when I haven't opened the app."
It sucks because it doesn't even work
There are so many annoying adds. Terrible experience and clunky user interface.
where is the teenage filter. to many adds
Falsely advertised. It's just a photo filter app. Nothing more. Ads portrayed it as a photo animation app. There's no animation in this app at all.
The app keeps stopping.
don't work. stops
it's not as advertised 6 thumbs down
Too soon to tell...
nice app
This app is garbage. The ad shows filters and features that don't exist and pop up ads happen while you are looking at the options and filters before you even take the first picture.
All it does is change the color filter. It has nothing to do with hair like advertise
so far so not so good
Wouldn't even work kept crashing everytime I go to upload or take my pic
Keeps ceashing
Epic
not anime
Garbage
False advertisement Uninstall immediately
Ads are a great big lie do not download.
wow this is super cool easy to install and take pictures and videos beautiful
It so good you should try it
this app is nothing like the commercial says it's going to be somewhere I supposed to get turn to a cartoon or something attempt to aviator or that's just my picture without color there's nothing that that commercial about this app is telling the truth about nothing I really should have gave it a 1 I was just feeling generous and gave it a 2
Deleted 2min after downloading...bs app!!!
False advertising
Trash not worthy of any stars.
Trash 🗑️
keeps closing
can't find the teenage filter
Ads whole not even using the app
Scam taking over your phone with ads when you not using the app
"I downloaded when I saw it on Facebook, I never even got to use it cus I had no time to but I started getting ads while using my phone on anything, as soon as I deleted this app I have nothing popping up on my screen anymore."
Honestly the app is false advertising because ur advertising shows what's there but when downloaded its nothing like u advertise...Honestly I think it's click bait and u should do way better
False advertising
Doesn't work waste of 2 mins
I don't know how I like it I just downloaded it give me a few minutes
Lucky you have a star for performance otherwise I would give you a 0 star's
Nothing like advertising..just regular filters
the app kept stopping
Horrible app. Too many adds and you can do most of everything on your own camera
App keeps stopping.
haven't actually tried it yet
crashes when you try to do something with pic. uninstalled
Too many ads! 🤬 There are so many ads that this game is NOT enjoyable! You can't even press a button without an ad popping up! Uninstalling! 😡
lillyanna
I like this
Lots of good features!
No I don't like ads
Liars!! this app does NOT artificially age your pictures
Downloaded and it immediately said it crashed. I uninstalled.
Horrible app. The ad for it has nothing to do with its actual capabilities. Your phone already does more than this app can do for you.
Useless app
It's a scam. The minute I installed it all these pop ups to meet women🤬😡🥵 First of all I am NOT AT ALL INTERESTED. I like🐓 One star is too many
Cant find the age filter which was shown on the ad
I hate this game 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"Far from ad , a lot of bugs too. Worthless"
"first time using, not responding....wonderful"
False advertising
Does not have any of the features claimed in the commercial. Waste of time.
"Only options appear to be color balance and smoothing, just has a bunch of silly names for the settings. There are better programs it there"
False advertising! you can not change your hair style. The camera app pre installed on most phones is way better than this!
Basically just false advertising
"All this is, is different colored filters. NOT AT ALL what the add said."
it's a really great app and I just love doing my pictures and they really come out good.
it really good app free to download
Horrible!!!! Nothings but Ads!!!!
Not as described...very basic.
I want to get hit in the head with a brick doesn't workkk at all
dont download trash
keeps closing on me. Tried it twice and the app doesn't work. waste of time. I disallow you to have access to my information since you failed to provide service of this app.
Doesn't do anything it says it can!
Blaaah!
"Wow ! what a waste of time. This app is a dead end, I didn't want to give it 1 star that's being generous. I wish Google would get involved with app creators and make sure they are legit. I'm curious about the 5 star reviews ."
Not as advertised
first time I tried to use it it shut down
it keeps kicking me out of the app
False advertisement about features with filters. They had ads showing you can do things that you can't even remotely do. Perm blacklisted
Doesn't do anything more than my phone's stock camera. False advertising. Downloaded to check out the teenage filter and it doesn't exist. Wish I could give zero stars
dunno how to give the aged look
"Every time you click on a different filter you're watching an add. I can see after a few minutes, but every filter you tap on disappointing 😞"
sucks
too many ads. too long
Terrible
Doesn't do what it's ad says it does.
👍👍👍
app keeps closing. unable to use
fake
love it.
Did not like
cant even take a pic a ADS CONSTANTLY DONT WASTE TIME IT JUST POPS ADS
EVERY click opens an ad you can't close. You have to close the app each time to close the ad because they won't close. Couldn't even check out a single feature. Not one. What a joke. Uninstalled.
Suck!!
It's false advertising! Ban this app!
False advertising
not good
"advertised as an age filter app. doesn't tell you how to do it, not even sure it does. not to mention touch any button, and it goes to 45 second ad every time"
Timothy Phillipsburg
False advertising
Doesn't do what the advertisement shows so it's completely bull!!!! 😡
Can't even use the app because there is an ad every 5 seconds. Very disappointed in this app!!
first time I used it crashed
No way to turn to face me
This app sucks
Misleading advertisement for this app.
kept stopping on me
excellent
Easy to be bright 😜
DONT INSTALL THIS JUNK APP!!! The play store needs to remove and ban this app for false advertising just like most of the apps that show ads. 100% deception and I'll look if filing a complaint is possible.
Does not work as advertized.
Has not used it yet. I hate reviewing something I never used.
The add lied and I'm soo dam pissed
Lies lies and false information. Where's the hairstyles ?
got me by fake ad
It is nothing like the add
"It's a scam app. As soon as I declined to give it access to my pictures and videos, it kicked me out of the app. I have uninstalled."
False advertising. Standard camera is better.

Cool
doesn't work
it's kinda difficult to use.confusing
the goat
Couldn't get it to work
SCAM
it was a good game for me
Not what advertised. There is no teenage filter.
I would join us at very much
it's pretty
as soon as I used it the app stopped working I only got thru taking my picture.
it's dull and false advertising for the filter To make you look young
I like this camera
Never seen any option for changing your age on an image. False advertising. Waste of a download.
"This app sucks because the ads that I got about this game looked cool, but when I downloaded it, I gave it a try, and the cool stuff that I thought would be there wasn't. Do not get this trashy app it's not worth it."
Terrible !!!!!
great

Awful!!! Downloads a hijacker and jumps to internet randomly for ads...ZERO STARS!!!!
False advertisement please delete app
Crashes constantly

False advertising.
"you can take a pic and change the color of it. like Black and white, and all the other shades. THAT'S it."
won't work
app doesn't work
I don't want public anything
This app is falsely advertised. It doesn't have the features it claims to have in its advertisements. It's just a color filter app. Deceptive advertising to get installs is 1-star worthy. Do better.
cool for me to make
"False advertising smh, go find your dad"
Great stuff
"Ad is very misleading, shows features that do NOT exist. Is full of ads. Avoid"
if I could give it 0 I would.
Didn't find this app to reveal anything but basic editing & smiley faces. Uninstalled.
Absolutely terrible
Horrible. Scam
Keeps stopping
False advertising. They have no options they they show in the adds.

"Every time I took a pic of myself to try it, it went back to the open app page. I uninstalled it."
App keeps stopping.
Saw an ad saying you could try different hairstyles on your photo to see how they look on you and I installed it and all it's is is a camera app with very limited features. Uninstalling....
black screen
"Terrible. Advertised doing advanced picture editing, but all it does it minimal tone changing editing. Doesn't do the ""teenage filter"" like Advertised and that's the only reason I downloaded so I will delete! You should get a 0 for lying. False advertisement."
JUNK UNINSTALLED
Don't waist your time with this app
It doesn't do what it is advertising. It only takes still pictures with filters. Stupid and a waste of my life!
Nothing like it shows it can do at all. My camera has same filters that this app does. Waste of time.
Crashed
No better than the camera that comes with any phone.
False advertising
Free Movies to Watch this APP On your APP
"It said You could try different hairstyles on yourself, but it only takes pics."
It helps.
"The pop up ads are terrible. They would come in when I wasn't in the app. It would close the window of what you're doing, and open up a web browser ad. Thought my phone had a virus🤦🏿‍♀️"
pretty good so far
i like this
App keeps crashing
I HATE YOUR APP! I hate it because when I take a photo of myself and press the check it just kicks me out! Like wth!? Do better and STOP making fake ads.
False advertising. I saw an ad for this regarding making a keyboard so I thought I could use this to make cool keyboards. Nope. It's just a camera and one that doesn't do anything. What a waste of my time.
A fake advertisement

Terrible
Bs...
"Never opened the app, planned on doing do when I had free time. Since download, ads opening in browser from cleared phone. I also had pop up ads with sound open from ""Settings."" Once i deleted the app, these issues ceased to exist."
You get random pop up adds when your not even in the stupid app i thought i had a virus or somthing but no its this stupid app i dont evrn know why i need you
It's just a camera app. No hairstyles whatsoever
Stupid App Don't install it
Doesn't work
Liars I is just a camera
it does not work
It told me not to waste my time with this app
"I saw an ad on social media about the ways to edit a picture, after I downloaded the app, found out that it didn't have any of the features shown in the ad. Waste of time."
Wouldn't even launch on a Pixel 6.
Awful app...was causing random ads and internet pages to pop up on my phone at all times.
Nothing happened. It wasn't working at all
sucks
doesn't deliver as advertised 😒

I was wanting to animate photos as an ad showed... but that's not actually an option!
Nothing like the ad
it's really bad
App make sence i download to see the backyard and it a cool camera! Ii

Not worth one star. False advertising - no hairstyles to experiment with. App forced to close immediately after I installed it.
C'mon man! Or whoa man. Too much trickery and deception.
good
sucks
It did not advertise it . It was very misleading It said that it was a age app unit was not.
False advertisement does not do what it says
keeps stopping
False advertisement. Okay so I can take a picture and change the filter. But I can do that with My original camera on My phone . No directions on how to even use the app . And also you can not erase things in the background and make it like it's not even there . Most definitely this app is a good idea if only it was real and worked as it is advertised ...will be uninstalling immediately
"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER! I was randomly getting ads while doing things on my phone that wouldn't normally have ads. I once got an ad in the Signal app. It has no ads. I got an add on my home screen. I was watching a YouTube video, the player went small into the bottom corner of my screen, and a blue spinning Circle was over my home screen. Eventually an ad like you see in other free ad-supported apps popped up. I had to use pop-up ad detector to figure out this was the rogue app!"
volt
No instruction doesn't give you hair styles to try with a photo of your face. Just collects photo and says they'll use it if you rate them....really?
App keeps stopping...
No instructions to use...advertises things it does not do.
So cool
cool
Nice app

"I didn't want to give this any stars but I had to , to post. I can't even give this any stars downloaded to see different hairstyles non-existent! It is just a filter and a bad one at that. You can't even save any of the photos you put a filter on. Just a poor app all the way around."
"Terrible app.. was looking for different hair styles ECT , this has NONE of that.."
Screwed up all the time so Uninstalled!!! Waste of time!
"False advertisement again! No hairstyle as was presented. Uninstaller right away. Don't even waste your time, guys, by installing this app"
Not what is advertised saw it to try on different hair styles and it sent me to this and then it crashes
no instructions
LIARS! FALSE ADVERTISING! Did this for the hairstyles. Ad says I can use this app to try different hairstyles on. Its just a filter. You cant try any hairstyles. Uninstalled
I unintalled without wasting my time after seeing the helpful reviews
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!IT IS A HORRIBLE APP!! I had no idea what was causing so many pop-ups on my phone! Random Websites opening even while I was doing nothing on my phone and it was on home screen. I had to go to my local store to have then fix the issue and it took forever until finally we went through the apps and saw this app was downloaded most recently. We got rid of it and BOOM problem solved!! Do not risk it!
keeps stopping!
Takes your picture but has no hairstyles at all that i can see.

This did absolutely nothing useful. It was so useless I worry that it slipped a bug on my phone.
terrible app! it keeps crashing and it's hard to figure out even how to use it!
This is stupid
keeps closing
Never actually used the app after I downloaded it but thanks to the popup ad detector I've learned that these scumbags are sending pop up ads to my phone. Uninstall immediately.
the app stopped working as soon as I clicked on my picture to select. So far I wouldn't even give it a one
excellent
Doesn't work
won't run
sucks

"Rubbish, there is no magic eraser.. only filters..."

"Kept crashing, couldn't use the hairstyle filter, there's not an easy way to not use a filter. Not for me."
"Shortly after downloading this app the newest one on my phone, suddenly my phone started to randomly pop open a browser window and display two different sales sites. Once I deleted it and restarted my phone, the issue went away. Very invasive, very upsetting."
Doesn't work
not what it advertises
False advertising.. nowhere can you see your face younger in real time. How dare you. Plus this is 25 mb huge. Deleting.
The experience was terrible because it would nt work at all is was so lame and pathetic.
It didn't do anything.
It takes beautiful pictures
I really like all this app. offers. I love playing with my photos.
👍😎✌️
Google must remove this people from fake apps
"Don't recommend this app at all. Didn't even open the app today, but it tried to open over 20 times. I have now uninstalled the app."
Wouldn't work
Didn't even do what the ad said it would. Kept crashing. Uninstalled
It didn't do.what it said.
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
"False advertising or the user interface is so counterintuitive that it's not worth our time. Needs a lot of work. Switch the camera around to look at my face and even that was broken, as if it's pointing the camera in the wrong direction or something? Like a pip screen? Pretty much every team of coders needs my as a project lead and they'd be wise to admit it and bring me on board."
Bad
It is not what is on the add
"it's just bad. no instructions, 30+seconds of ads after each movement. if it dies something worth while couldn't get to it. not worth my time. uninstalled"
False advertising
It doesn't work just take some picture of you
Didn't work for me.
D idnt work for me at all
It's a stupid I thought I could see my age
Never used the app. So why the rating? It would randomly launch ads via my browser while I am in other apps. Avoid.
I thought it shows u what u look like older but it doesn't..
Very bad
Not what it seems to be
I am not even going to rate this because it's absolutely bogus waste of time what I seen on the app was you can spy on someone from satellite like in terms of using Google Earth store it'll pull up someone's location or place.
What does shooting at space ships have to do with trying different hairstyles? This is a scam that doesn't do anything
Deceptive advertising
Gives you know details on how to use
This is ridiculous! No hair on here to try!
Worst app ever a boost add is the first thing you see and they want you to down load that before anything . Sucks.
No where to look for hairstyles as advertised
Won't work k right. Too I volved
"False advertising. Your showing that you can take pictures anywhere in the world, but all you can do is take pictures with my camera that's already on my phone."
It advertised that I could see what I looked like at an older age .... but it don't.... this app is garbage.
This is trash.
Does not do what it says
No directions on how to use
Didn't work
You duck doesn't work
Downloaded to try different hairstyles. It had nothing if the sort. Only stupid filters. My phone has more & better filter options. Uninstalling right now

Fake advertising the app is ad and ad and ad
"It showed hair app, yet doesn't go there"
It's not working at all.
Kept freezing
I can't make my self look older all I can do is take pictures of myself i don't like this game hope you can do better
You suck your ad implies filters
Terrible app. literally less than 30 seconds there's ads and then every time you switch between a filter there's ads.
Doesn't work at all.. very misleading..
Too complicated. After 5 minutes I still couldn't get it to work. Goodbye
I hate it
Doesn't have the young filter as advertised
Pos
"This app is terrible.In the ad,it shows that you can animate pictures and you can get backgrounds but when I installed it, none of those features were there. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. This app will waste your time. I know it's wasted mine for sure."
"Doesn't work , it's misleading."
Just downloaded and it won't upload my photos from.my gallery. Pointless.
Sucks

This is false advertising! & NOT what's advertising at Facebook! Every click is 💩
Sucks
"Doesn't really do anything. I wanted to see different hair styles, not on this app. It takes pictures of you, for you, but your camera does that, right? Don't see any need for this app other then to delete it."
You miss leed people
Not what I wanted
Not as described
Can't figure out the way I saw pics
"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! It's absolute trash, just a camera filter. You can't use existing pictures. In the ad they showed a picture Bruce Lee become animated and act like Mr. Bean. There was no animation option.... you can't even get into your existing photos. I would give it zero stars if they'd let me."
Very confusing app i cant figure out how to access the hair changes??
"Wasteful all it does is takes pictures of you, THEN THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY ""rate us 5 starts"" 🤨💢💢"
Ads is over buttons and where is the different hair styles

Many ads can't get AP to go past start page..It forces a rating before using
Wear is the slide button
So good
don't like it not like it was advertised
"Apps straight trash, doesn't do what it states in terms of ad... False advertising No stars because you deserve none"
"The app ask for permission to access my photos, but when I try to upload one it only gives me the option to take a new picture."
Why do you say free?
Don't try it's so worse doesn'tt work Or like what like what it is not the best.
Horrible app once you get through ads no direction on what to do deleted within 5 min of downloading
Is NOTHING LIKE WHAT I SAW IN ADD. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST THIS HAPPENS.
I thought it was supposed to show different hair styles
Not as advertised. I was interested in the different hairstyles and didn't see any different hairstyles at all.
Not what it's cracked up to be.
Too many ads
"To many Ads, no directions! Waste of time. ""POOPY!"""
Bad
Too many ads. I can't choose a filter before another ad pops up
Haven't
Stupid asf
This app is terrible it was stuck on camera filters
Nothing about hairstyles here
Can't get anything done before ad after ad hits you
It sucks
All ads
1 because I can't put a 0
Wasn't letting me look of how old I look and get
Doesn't work. No instruction.
It sucks
Not a earth cam. Just a photo app.
