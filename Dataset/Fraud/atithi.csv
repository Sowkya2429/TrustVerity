Maine tomato catchup extra bhejne ko bola tha vo bhi nhi bhej paye or 15 minute m delivery Dene ka show krta h or aata h 40 min m thanda pizza
Bad app doesnot work anytime always i fill my cart and after sometime all items get deleted by itself...al my 15 20 min waste everytime
"Cant even proceed to cart for place the order worst app ever seen, always they have some excuses. Just worst app with worst management."
Delivery is bad sometimes and there is always a glitch in tracking section as the location of the delivery guy remains the same and we can't track it anyway.
Poor app paisa refund nhi karte Or delivery bhi nhi pahuchate fake app he lakhimpur la poor restaurant he
Good app for all things groceries and restaurant food is awesome

When you take home delivery of something and then u complaint regarding that then someone says we are providing you next parcel please wait..The n receptionist call u and says that sir this is the original gravy of our recipe maybe u don't know the taste of food there is some issue but our Quality is number 1.. Everything is fine sir..please eat that food this is the staff behavior and this is the Quality atithi restaurant is providing. WORST TASTE
Very Bad experience with Atithi grocery. They Delivered seal broken items and Near Expiry items even i got the same month expiry product of this Year which delivered in july. Very very bad experience. Mostly Expired or Near Expiry items sold.
"DO NOT USE THIS FRAUD APP..!! This is the worst app in terms of app bugs and the restaurant service. They are looting people's hard earned money by giving them offer to get 20% cashback into wallet and then a customer cannot even use their wallet money.. also when told query over call, the employees are giving rubbish and illogical reasons like asking to restart the phone or empty the cart then wallet money would come back. They all are uneducated and unprofessional..!!"
Very bad online delivery. I ordered at 9 pm. The delivery boy delivered it on 10.30 pm and when I opened it was wrong item. Then he came back to collect it on 11 pm. After that I ordered from another restaurant. I am very disappointed with this restaurant.
Sometimes vegetables are stale
Nice experience service is good I got my order on time properly everytime
Good experience I am fully satisfied with products and fast delivery some time delay but overall good service üôÇ..
Very Bad behaviour Grocery manager I am not satisfied this type language

Meri bahan har mahine rasan magati h Very nice service
The prices are high and the management is rude
Very usefull app
Food Delivery always be poor.
They are all an idiot I ordered a patanjali product and haven't received it yet and then too it says it is delivered. Idiots
Worst experience This Time We ordered Onion Dosa And there surprisingly Ghere was no onion in the batter. Only it was roated and sprinkled on the Top Of The Dosa. Also They Have Not Mentioned That There Will Be Green Chilli Mixed. So This was the worst experience. I Do Not Recommend Any One To Eat Dosa Here.
Very poor food Quality of this hotal they can't worth for our money and charging rates to high
BEST APP GROSERY( LAKHIMPUR )
Very good app for every requrement in your hand
Price remains the same even after updating and install again and again due to which my two orders were canceled .
Fantastic app for food üëçgrocery üòã service is amazing üëè customer talking sense is very gently I like it üëå best app for shopping here in lmp üòäthanks üòäüòÄ
Worst app ever to order food in Lakhimpur If you want to order dinner from atithi then you have to order it in morning then only you will recieve for dinner
Sometimes delays but overall better experience in food and service üòå
Better
"They are cheating and doing fraud against wallet amount. Make ur money expired in one month, without any message or email. They give only excuses for any thing related with app. Worst app & wallet policy. Don't use this app."
"Good service , delicious food best restaurants in Lakhimpur ,,,,"
"ATITHI is selling some items more than M R P. They have nutral iffect of complaint or feedback. Even not ready to listen , what customer is saying about your product ,rate or services.I have bought some items on 20.08.2021,which were billed on more than M R P, but their feedback team is expert enough to explain that M R P is nothing. We are selling items based on market. The one thing that you can't say your issue to any responsible person or owner is very special."
This restaurant is pathetic and no one should go there.. the staff does not have any etiquette of talking and do not have any dignity.. The owner too does not carry any responsibility of serving people in a right manner... This restaurant is a cheater and has got opened to just mint money... Not sure if I can give negative stars... I might have given -100.
They serve good quality in restaurent section. I don't know how are they in grocery. Tastewise they serve better Application needs some improvement . So my rating would be 4.2
You will never get full weight of items you order but you will pay full amount
"The product which I purchase from atithi grocery store was damaged , not satisfied, received seal broken item"
"Worst experience, most of the time they send expired food products !!!!! And also they deliver seal broken products.. Also quality of vegetables is not upto the mark"
Chowmein was not freshly cooked nd paneer was under cooked. Previous experience was same. Not improved.
It is always showing address issue

Quality of vegetables in Atithi grocery is very inferior. No resolution for Customer complaints in quality and cashback. Always try to provide better quality & service to customers to reach at the top.
Good service hai lekin delivery charges 450 par free hai ye bhut hi high hai kam se kam 250 par delivery charged nhi lagana chaihiye dusri app toh 100 par hi delivery charge nhi lete. Plz is par dhyaan de
Very poor service ..mostly expired items sold
I have faced following issues: 1. They delievered seal broken items and when I called them they behaved very rudely. 2. Sometimes some items are missing from the delivered package. If you ask about your missing product they will ask you to come to their warehouse to pick that item. So don't trust them. 3. With someitems the manufacturing company provide some free items but the atithi guys will keep that free item with them. So basically they are fraud.
grocery ka cashback restorent me kyo dena jb paisa humne grocery me diya hai to cashback bhi grocery order pr hi milna chahiye mujhe online khana magana hi nhi hai to mere liye mera cashback bekar hi hai
Vegetables quality is not good..i told 3 times but no responce i think market is good option to buy vegetables..
Staff trying to cancel the order you placed
Don't order any thing from atithi.they are selling old and expiry product.customer service is very bad.
Very late orders delivery and I have don't loctae my orders üòïüòï
Very very bad....
"I am giving 4 stars because they are committed to their services & app is just good, not perfect. Search needs to be improved a lot. They are really doing great by providing home delivery services in this pandemic time.(Don't forget, I am talking about the place Lakhimpur Kheri, where home delivery is still a growing concept). This app needs improvement in terms of search. Searching for Sugar keyword should also show cheeni and similar products."
Worst app.
Service not good very careless

"Testy food with speedy disposal. Keep it up, good wishes ."
Worst service i have ever had. I have ordered 2 pizzas and got delivered after 2hrs and after payment there is no option to cancel the order. And there is a plastic inside the pizza. The food quality of atithi is getting deteriorated day by day. Worst very worst.
Wrost experience
Wallet use TnC not clear and not customer friendly. Cashback is a trap You can't use complete wallet amount. Unreasonable delivery charges on wallet use even complete order is above 180.
"Worst app and restaurant I have ever seen. I had veey bad experience with this restaurant and their staff. No cancel option is provided in the app and if you call the restaurant,they also neither cancel it nor provide any help from there side. Customer satisfaction is zero. They don't even care about his customers and their feedback. I recommend everyone to try other restaurant who can have some dignity towards its customers."
Nice
Best food app in lakhimpur Quality and quantity is to good best food service provider in lakhimpur Thanks atithi
