Zero because it's misleading advertising and need to pay
"Worst app ever seen....when it says to take a picture of the palm, i just took a picture of my center table and the app started recognising the fate line,heart line....omg. How can a table have all this line...and if you want to know more than pay lol, that was the funniest experience..."
Not worth installing
Wastage
Only paid don't use waste of time
Lame af. Take ur details and ask you to pay.
Only works if you pay.
Waste app don't download it starting they show for free and they show payment package
If you need payment then why are you collecting detail of person . Just to show basic reading. Even I can do free basic palm reading for free
Not working bad app
fraud 🤥
Good
maine 620 rupye payment kiya but unlock kahan ho raha
Always want mony
"Fake app, aksing for money and no result"
It's a generic prediction that they use They use generic terms and words that won't describe any thing nor deny. Total waste of money
Good like
Its only fake things here
Jus money minded app Told nothing about my palm jus asked for money
So chip appp
Fake app
Hide charges aap
Fake Very dangerous app Please don't download
"I am here to rating this app, and the rating is 1 out of 5 star. Trust me bro this is really fake app. There is nothing at all . It give fake information about your future as well as present. Don't install this type of app."

Non sense app

"Worst app ever, this app must be banned"
"Please make it more affordable for Turkey, I would definitely make a subscription if it was available."
Horrid
doesnt deserve any single star. ill put one just to rem8nd the developer that we will not pay any single dime. got it?
No free content
cool
excellent
"You'll provide DOB, email & name. Free subscription/results on a basic level are fun! Horoscope sign & compatibility, biometric system, & talisman tap freebies. I wish the palm read was free, but I can see the allure. Pricing for subscription is not poorly priced. Try it on a basic level first for a few months, check-in on relativity over 3 months or so. Purchase after you've made a sound conclusion. Overall, 😉!"
Uninstall. You need to have a paid subscription before you get any reading done.
"Hello,I have paid for my subscription but my daily horoscope is not coming but weekly, monthly and yearly is available.why??"
මෙවැනි ආකාරයේ යෙදුම් අතරින් පලවෙනි ස්ථානයේ තැබිය හැකි ඉතාමත් හොඳ ඉතාමත් අනර්ඝ යෙදුමකි
Payment work only
worst app ever....

It's good
SUNILRISHI
Fake app
Nice app
best of luck
The back button doesn't close the app. I had to exit using task manager. Except for the daily horoscope general prediction everything else seems to come with a good service charge. I was looking for palm reading. It hung up first then asked me money to proceed. Not bad for a business perspective. But I didn't see that coming. It's emotional cheating. App functionalities are good though.
Please am not using the app anymore and you are still deducting money from my account pls end it else I will report this app as a scam
Bad app
"Money, money, money"
bad
I know my future
Bad
👎
This game's the BEST!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆it told me about my palm marks!!!☻️🥳🤠🤑🤣😂😅😆😁😄😃😀😉😊😇🥰😍🤩😘😗☺️😚😙🥲😋😛😜🤪😝🤗
"This app is the best, it tells me what will happen in my life daily and it happens truly like magic,"
Have to pay loads of money. Did my palm and coukdnt get acses to anything even though it processed it would give 0 stars if i could dont get if you want to keep your money.🙄
Worst app
"Hidden fees you have to pay for a subscribtion to see the results there is no testing for free, not worth tge risk. And they want a weekly payment of 8 pound per week"
it's the best
Cool
The best!
ISSA SCAM you can't find out nothing without paying
Bad people
I think it is true...😊
Unused
Ok
i didn't understand
Worst app
Very good
Downloaded app it allowed me to put in my data and scan my palm but as soon as it went to analyse it asked me to pay. Not free.
Waste
Makes you pay so naw it ain't good
Excited
"This is a paid app. They just do not tell it upfront, but will start asking for money as soon as you scan your palm. It is a waste of time. Bad business practice."
Way too expensive if you ask me. Cannot pat that much for an app
"I find the palm reading to be very accurate, 5 stars for that. I do find the psychic help to be a little on the liberal side in political leanings but overall good, still I'm giving it 5 stars, great job"
"Please delete my palm photo, you guys took my palm photo then asked for money to view results. Please give confirmation when you guys have done so."
it is good app
Not a free app
it good and l like it
Nice app thank you for this application very very interested
Please make it free
Several sites and blogs recommended this app for being the top/most reliable FREE palm reading app but IT IS NOT FREE AT ALL. It also will not save my birthday correctly in the settings. I'm a cusp sign so it saving my bday a day earlier makes it provide data for an entirely different zodiac sign so overall this app is false advertising and frustrating not helpful or useful.
Excellent perfecto...big ups
Although I am not totally convinced if it's all true I still enjoyed it.😊
this is a free app but asks for a lot in money within!
Not as great as I hoped
Fake it's not free
Not a gud app
Too costly
"This thing keeps changing my birthday. I put in March 15, 1959. But, the app keeps changing it to March 14, 1959. Why??????"
It is eye opener
"Thanks for being honest with me God bless you for me. Please friend and family do this and know the truth about your self, you will not regret doing it."
worst stupid
bus thik ha fazool hi lag raha
nicd
Very boring indeed

"You said it's a free app but why are you asking for money again,this one naa scam abi ahhhhhh."

Useless app

"When the advertisement says its free , then ot should be. Its cheating"
They should allow some of the activities to be free. Also R130 a week for predictions?
I love this app. It give me a good outlook into life that I may otherwise miss.
Complete scam
amaizing
"Asks you for money, not trial"
I am having an issue purchasing the subscription.

"totally payment base, while so many apps are giving best services @ free"
You don't ask for payment after collecting all user's data. That's just not right. One star from me. That's it.
"I cannot just pay and I am not sure even if it will work, atleast give 1 reading or 2 for free"
Don't use it After installing without payment you not find any information
F ac
Good
"For Indians who download this app, going to a Pandit/Jyotish will be better ad this app reveals nothing at all."
Too expensive

the only bad thing is that they make you pay money on certain things
"this app should not be here , it waste your time as well as memory, the best thing is to report this app so that Google remove it from the play store"
it's a great experience to have this app
If u r really obsessed to know and u can spend money for it... then go ahead and download it... Useless at last I wud say... it's not free

it froze so couldn't use it.

Seems pretty cool and interesting
Amazingly accurate. It describes word for picture just like if it was someone who knows you
you have to pay :(
dont make people subscribe to a app they downloaded for free
"this app isn't free, you enter all your info and then it prompts a 3 day trial but you have to enter payment info... no thanks."
I dont need to pay 20 a month for free reading. scam
sucks
fake
it was pretty accurate
"Cant use App without signing up for a 3-day trial, THEN it is $19.99/PER MONTH! Disappointed that the fees arent lower or the trial period isnt longer. UNINSTALL."
makes you pay! not worth it at all
As soon as you search for results they show the hidden fee window... which I hated it the most... plus the free 3 day trial is just another idea of making people pay... it sucks..
Worst app
It sucked it's all money they want
Very poor app and they're only motive is to make money pls take this app from playstore waste of time...
"Let's be clear here, they give you the exact same reading for each person which is a great money making scheme even if they tell you its randomized. Either it is a scam (to get your formation) or you just happen to have the EXACT profiles as your friends (correlation argument not valid here). Terrible lol"
True app
Worst app
Don't wanna pay for the app when I can get a reading for much less
Haho
Fake app
Ridiculous 😠😠😠😠
Money hungry fools
Wants you to pay for a trial after they get your email
Not willing to pay for something like this. Lots of people give readings for much better pricing
So far so good!
'free trail' hate to review. But there is no free trail
Completely nonsense app. It does not even gives a free trial to test you palm. As soon as you give you details it asks money even to start trial. I hated this app a lot.
Tatti hai app will ask you to join subscription that's it
This is daft to ask for payment details upfront and that can not be truly a free trial. Why the heck should anyone give payment details first?
I don't like when you have to pay for a period and then when you are starting it is free thankyou
Totally ridiculous. It's makes you think you can just take a picture and see the results but oh no that would be too easy. You take a picture of your palm and then they make you start a free trial before you see the results. Worthless app. Far better ones out there. Just keep looking.
Nice app
Helps me see who I am. The things it says are so true about people.
﻿Feel this app is absolutely right. I think this app is amazing and gives positive outlooks
Bad
Hope what it says is true
Love it
It worst app. Not allows me to know resuts!!! no free trial at all!! Do you what to mean by free trail?? First go and serach in dictionary or google. What free trail means!! Don't is tall. It's time wste!!
Claims it was free . False advertising
I was never even able to take a picture for the palm reading.
Misleading It's supposed to be free but yet it requires a payment
They charge you !
No working
Dash....... App waste of time... Nothing is there except u pay
"money looting app , don't waste your time and money"
They should probably start asking money to even download the app
"Before you are allowed to do anything it will ask for payments, quite 
literary a P2W but without the game."
This app is just waste of time and money
False advertisement.
Fraud
You have to pay for it
Very inaccurate. It's a total SCAM...
Accurate and does the job!
"Online scam...nothing else. Making use of people's curiosity to make money. 
Nobody pays thousand rupees for palmistry."
Worst.. shittiest app.. y will u pay to show haan
"Lukhhaaa 6e sala, after hand scan, they want payment to show data lol😾😾😾"
You guys are right it does nothing
hand reading is detailed and comprehensive
Worst app ever .. Trying to fool people
This is the worst app . I hate it. Pls don't download
Fake app they just want money from nothing else
Not worth it
Worst app
This app is really good but it's just so not worth the price it's asking for
This is not real fake as heck!
"Its worst app cant read properly and didint show result they only want to 
install app.."
"I would like a refund as soon as possible. I just downloaded the app today 
and it's not at all what I expected and frankly I'm disappointed. I've 
already emailed the developer. Please process this request as soon as 
possible. Thank you."
I like it
It's amaging
"When you get this app, it does not let you see your results unless you pay"
I found everything accurate ....
The only problem is money.
"Guys , this not real . They are cheating to get money . Please dont buy 
anything from the app . It is a cheat . The second time look on the 
horoscope is different from the first . I hate this app ."
I don't liked this😕
"Wow... pretty accurate...update: I purchased the extended reading about a 
month ago and now it is asking me to repurchase?......"
It's good
It will ask for money
Good
It's a good app
Absolutely bakwas
bekar
"Very interesting. I wouldn't advise paying for it. But very interesting 
palm reading. I love the daily horoscope for a good read and some 
inspiration."
Nailed it
Nice app!!!
"You're whole idea is to give people an insight into their palmistry. To 
give them the option to fill in all their details and even take a photo of 
their hand and then require them to pay for it is absolutely rediculous and 
a bad way to ask for money. It comes off as a scam and I deleted the app 
immediately. You're not getting my money!"
Worst app ever!
"As soon as it took picture,it asked for 10$ purchase. No trials, not 
recommended"
Fake and cheat. Do not share your personal details.
Its is good app. Dont purchase any thing . Interesting.
Gand mari app
Interesting
"Dont purchase anything. After reading the reviews I thought it was 
interesting. But that's just a ploy. Well dummy me went through the process 
and even paid for the premium $11.99 thinking i would received what was 
started. Lies Lies Lies. At least thats just how I feel."
Poor
Awesomely cool!!
I love the palm reading just wish there was more free readings. There wasn't anything leading up till the download that lead me to believe I'd have to pay for the readings.
Eh
Waste of money. Generic reading. Paid £11.99 for load of rubbish.
False
"I'm  interested in  horoscope and palmistry  readings, so it's nice n excited to me!!!"
I love the app. Very good and spot on.
I cant believe that they advertised it was free. Well its not. Its 11.99 for a palm reading. And i would have paid for it but they have too many bad reviews and aome people have said that they are all the same readings. That it doesn't matter how old you are and what your palm looks like they all are the same reading. So one star for false advertising and one star for lying
It okay
Says it's free but you have to pay for it to give you a reading.
"I haven't paid for a full palm reading because I'm more sceptic than what I thought I would be, so I'm unsure about that but Horoscope is nice."
Luke it
It's a good game I like it
Mucho mas  bonito pinche Verde pollo.. Turkey is wonderful in the pitch black of midsummers night y'all!!
"At first, I thought it would group me with other Libra's. However, it was really accurate for me. I would recommend this."
App of it's own kind
Thumbs up
Thought it was free
cost for the full pal reading but horoscope is creepily accurate
Thought it was accurate as heck at first. Compared it to someone else's reading who's a completely different age and birthday and it was the exact same! A clever sham. Don't buy!
All these are true
This app is a sham!
It's Aosome
The only thing that is wrong in this app is the sign of gemini and the sign of pisces are mixed up. Otherwise its a great app
Super cool App
Good .
So far so good
Very accurate
It is very accurate in terms of results. The paid results are really an eye opener in that you dont really think they are so detailed until you see them. My advice to u all is to pay because of all the categories the results offer and how those results affect you on a personal level. You will see what i mean if u do. Good day.
Y
Good but money priority.........
This is the best palm reading app I have seen yet.
Quite detailed.  Not bad.
I didn't think it would be this accurate.
I just hate it
Baka ra
Please dont download
Nice app but money is your priorty
Okk
Money oriented
Very very very good app
bad experience...tried 3 times bt result got stuck at 24 percent...
Worst app
Can it be free for the palm sccaning
..... you should tell before installing..that we need to pay.
Sucking...
It's very bad app. First of all it won't take the pic of ur palm correctly then it take much more time to click a picture and after that this app ask for money. If u want the damn money then tell us in the starting. It wastes all my time. It's just like shut app.
Nice appearance smooth scrolling but way to much money & the fact that the payment comes before any results after you scan your hand is extremely aggravating. Uninstalled. Come down on the price (a lot) & I would love to download again.
App Is Good & Real... But You Have To Pay Money...
Charging too much money
"Rubbish, i'll advise all not to install..if want to look a result, must have to pay.."
Camera not opening...... great
This app is good when u can pay..results need to pay...pointless to install. Uninstalling now.
Try it out
"I had high hopes for this app, but unfortunately when ever I got to the reading section it would constantly keep saying camera not open. But after reading other reviews, i find that this app isn't free. It seems like another buisness which just wants to take cheap ass money of users and exploit its audience, highly recommend that you stay away from this app."
Third class. Asks for payment in the first run only.
Good
"Advertised as free, but actually costs £11.99 for a reading. Not prepared to pay that, especially when I was told it'd cost nothing."
all good but I wish it was completely free app
This is the best app in the world I have ever seen
Nice app...
bakvas
Pesh bsuli h ye sub
I just think if its true then im looking forward for this to recommend  my friends.
Best
Nice app
Backwash hai koi mat krna
i suggest not to install this app ... why to pay 800 for palm reading .. ?? and analysis also comes wrong ...
I think great app but belvedere ya no belvedere
Bakwas hai koi pagal hi hoga palm reading ke liye pay karega chutiyapa hai ye app jhantu log
It tells us about the truth..
Amazing
Nice way to suggest our future
Please I need premium
Please retry guy's it does have a free palm reading  and it seems pretty neat as far as the free palm reading I really liked it I wish I could have gone with the larger palm reading but I have no credit card 😔
Tera baap degA kya money
Hate this app its not working
Best time/mobile data wasting app.
Damn good
Very bad app don't install it
Not bad
It must atlease give a paragraph about marriage it would be wonderfull
this app is amazing its a wonderful app great app
Good one
Waste of time  Atleast they should give 1 trail palm reading  That we can how it's working
Good
Don't install it. They need huge  money for reading palm.
I like this app its true detilas getting
Just loved it. If it could be free of cost...
So true..
Great app!!
Great Application....
LOVE U...Wonderful  Application Working  Apps
Its an interesting app but I don't know that its real or not
I've just started with this app I'll let you know how it is after few days
😆😆😆
I think this app is good but I have question that is this app tell the truth about your life 🤔🤔🤔
i like that all
Its really true
Tells evrything correct about u
Really good n accurate worth trying
Worst waiting for 15 mins @ 1% still processing the image taken. I knew this won't work just wanted to try to what extent it can go... Its stuck in begging.
"It's a cool application,may the good vibes will sugestion me to reach my goals"
nice app
Worst app!!
Waste of time!
"The reading is pretty accurate! Very interesting! Although, it's quite costly to know more. Also, initially I had problems getting the app to read my palm, but managed to in the end. :)"
"Absolutely hoax. Without camera being focused it gives the reading. Despite taking the premium reading, it gives the reading as per your date of birth instead of your palm.   Do not use it. They dont even show the picture taken. Its all random and generalised reading."
Fake app writes same thing for everyone.
No
Bad
Very nice app. Very easy to see things about yourself
Nice
Good app
I don't know if it is real or not but fun to use
Truth
It's a lough deed .U take DOB and calculate according to that and only make palm reading to make fool people.this is cunning... making money...
Worst app.....not even opens
Best
It showed pretty interesting and accurate things about me. But is too pricey for greater information
It's a best app which makes man Confident for his/her future...
Fake
Stupid app Didn't read the plam in photograph
Need to give few more free options
Useless u need to b prime mamber for reading ur palm
It was very interesting
Worse
It actually guess my yesterday future. Five instant stars 10/10👍👍😊
Nice one
Fake app...
Perfact palm reading app good app
Palm future right send money poor peoples worlds help money life see photo received dont
poor app
Fun so far
Nice work
It's ok
Good app
Good app but why u charge for further details
Fake
Quit believable
Beautiful
"Fake, the provided info is fake and general"
Its pretty perfect!!
Fun and about 90% accurate I would say. I only did the free version of the palmistry but would consider the full reports too.
Bab relly bad
Awsm app ..
Nothing happens when you click the palm reading result button and the 4 options below the button is locked. I would rate 0 stars for this kind of app
I'm shock that this app tell what is happening in my life or how realistic their message is... It's really good.
So stupid. The first thing you asked before even giving one result is money.
Easy to use
Awesome accuracy and detail
The best app for knowing your future😊😊😊 but we have to pay to know more😢😢😢
Good
Good app but can have a bit more free feature for atleast trial
This app is helpful for your future so many logincs and information about the future
I love this app but to learn more about yourself you need to pay which I believe is unfair.
Good enough
Excellent thanks
Good app
I love this app
Its good
Good positive impact on me
😘😘
Like to see in gujarati 💐💐👌👌
This app is hilarious
Costly
Utter waste
Very Nice
Its cool
Great app
Worst app
"Bad, fake, useless all the same results"
Worst app... A small circle to fit ur palm n then it says can't read ur palm
Nice app!!
Awesome
As an astrologer i just say that Predictions are good but 800/- for computerized prediction?   Who buy your service. Very bad experiences.
Very easy to use app.
Outstanding Experience. Highly Recommended.
Nice one. I love this App. It's highly recommended for Android users
Great app!
Amazing!!
Dead on about me and that's not a eazey thing to do!
"It's a well made bit of fun, but you really don't get a lot for free and I object to paying £11.99 to get more than the absolute basics"
Dont download... Waste of time... Ur palm is just ur palm not ur future.
