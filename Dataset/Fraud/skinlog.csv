"i like the concept but the image upload is low quality. there's like a smoothing, artifact effect on the photos. i would like the image upload to be better quality to better capture the texture of the skin to see any real changes or progress."
"Pretty good skin diary like type of app with selfie uploading. And, it's free, frfr."
So far so good. Just having a hard time taking pic for my skin analysis because of the lighting.
"Been testing different apps for tracking my skin and this one is so far the best. It's easy to add entries for skin feel, food I ate, skin Care for that day, water intake and emotions for that day. It makes it really easy to track and check the different things that can be affecting your skin! I prefer this app over the Trove app. I can freely change the routine day by day rather than fighting to change or remove the routines like in Trove. I would like to see reminders for product expiry."
Good experience and only 1 thing Kindly make the app fully in english version or provide the option to change language of the app.. Thank you âœ¨
Sorry to say that I can't understand the language
"Honestly I was a bit skeptical,because there were no views. I mainly install apps based on it's comments. So I took a leap of faith,and I'm glad I did."
"Exactly what I've been looking for to track my skin progress with pictures, create a routine, leave notes for myself etc. I can now delete the 3 other apps I was using and just keep this ðŸ™‚"
