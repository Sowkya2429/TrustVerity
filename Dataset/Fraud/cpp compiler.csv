It is very helpful app for coding of c++programming
"This app is really great. The challenges and examples, and even has no ads. Nonetheless, I couldn't copy my own program; can you please fix that?"
Keep up the good work. Please Make this app run in landscape mode specially for tablet user. Thank you.
You can't use it without internet üòé
App is amazing the only problem was i couldn't copy code that i write but it saves in the app that's a plus point
Super awesome
Wrost app I recommend you don't download this app
I think it works using internet. Can I get an offline version of it please?

What disgraceful app.... It could not run my program at all.
Think Like A Coder: The Adventure Begins
Worst app for c++ compiler.. I tried to excute my c++ code but the compiler shows that the program is big and try smaller program
"Worst app, The Cursor go anywhere it wants. I didn't like it , even a bit."
"bro whoever made this app, live 100 years bro ,like you actually saved me iam not even joking , i was so confused that where should i do the coding because there was not even a single app useful, but this app is worth more than 5 stars ,thanksssssss so much"
