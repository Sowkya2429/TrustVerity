Couldnt choose location; horrible!
"App kept crashing, so I uninstalled and now it wont let me reinstall it. Talking to other people they are having the same problem. You are losing money!! My company has finally decided to look into other car rental agencies. Please fix so I dont have to rent at budget. This app even in existence anymore? By the way your national app sucks too!"
Didn't work 8
"this app is not in English, I tried both apps they get the worse rating!!!"
Nice
Crsppy people om Orlando
Worst ever
"App doesn't recognize my enterprise car rental account credentials, rendering it useless."
"If you're ready to get stuck in front of a car that doesn't open, with your children in freezing cold in a town you don't know, and a customer service that is never online go ahead and have your try. I'm not writing this for the social media guy hired by this company to copy-paste. ""We're sorry about your bad experience blah blah...."". I'm hoping the team behind this terrible app and irresponsible management will read this. And hopefully change things. I got no refund for a complete day lost."
Sucks. Need to get verification code closes app so no place to put code except start over. Feels like groundhog day
Cant sign in
This app does not work for Android 8.0 system. Older app work wonderful. This application thinks I need to travel worldwide. Older application work perfectly for my use.....personal and business.
"0/10, sehr selten funktioniert das Öffnen und schließen des Autos mit der App. Und das mit einem Galaxy S23+ darf nicht sein. Das man bei Kälte 20 Jahre draußen warten muss nur weil diese schlecht programmierte App das Auto nicht aufschließt ist einfach nur erbärmlich. Davon abgesehen ist es ein cooles Konzept. Leider ist die Umsetzung der App 0/10. Selbst im flight mode mit Bluetooth und GPS only geht es auch nicht."
Would not accept my login information
The old app was much better
Can't log in
This app does not work. I've been renting from enterprise for years and this app won't even pull up a Us location let alone my city. Can you please bring the old one back???
"Phone camera doesn't work on all Pixel phones for identity check. Couldn't end my rental at the end as the rental section on the app was not available. Otherwise it's a great app for booking rentals, the key in the app works very well."
"Please bring back the old app!! It will only show me rental locations in Germany. I use your rental service a lot, & loved the old app, so easy to use. New app is horrible!! I was getting ready to reserve a rental for Florida & no rental places show for FL?1?!?"
It appears this app was abandoned or never updated. I tried to use but there was no options available in my city. App gave no clear indication how to move forward. Also I tried to delete my card info and it wouldn't. Appears shady from what I can ascertain which is not much. Not user friendly at all.
"Lost my points. Didn't need this ""new"" app. Error message for app said this newer version doesn't support my phone?? Lost customers. Does that solve the problem? AVIS takes less of a deposit. Hope this newer version works for you Enterprise. See Ya!"
"Awful! What happened to the old one? Download the app, doesn't even pick up my location. I downloaded this one because I was informed the old 1 would not work on my Galaxy S8 anymore So once I downloaded thit's different from the old one and not it all better"
"Wow, I can only select locations in Switzerland. Crá ‽ Search area cannot be changed to the US, multiple installs..."
I'm confused how such a big company can have such a poorly designed app and be okay with it. Made me second guess renting with you guys. App makes it too much of a pain.
Don't work with car rental
"Does work offline, take ages for the keys to connect to the car. Very not user friendly and offer no flexibility outside the fact that you can pickup the car without interaction with an agent. Outside of that you can't extend your booking, you can't add driver..."
Terrible.
"It's an amazing idea with very reasonable prices, the only problem is that the app is still unreliable and the key crashes on newer phones with latest versions of android/iOS, so make sure you carry an older phone as a backup to ensure you can unlock the car. For example, the app works fine for me on a Pixel 1 on Android 10 but crashes on a Pixel 7 Pro on Android 13."
"Identity verification process: After taking the selfie generic error message ""Ooops something went wrong""."
"Horrible app with the initial sign up process. You need to verify identity, and one of the steps involves taking a selfie, but the app wouldn't open camera despite all app permissions in place."
Great car and helpful customer service! It would be great though if you could have 24/7 customer/app support instead of just the working hours and a direct line instead of support only via emails
very bad does not. shows country or location on huawei phones
"Easiest way to rent a car, would recommend."
Simple and easy to use. Definitely would recommend.
"Love the product! It's easy, simple and convenient. Highly recommend it!"
