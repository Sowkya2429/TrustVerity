16,Constantly crashes
17,"Was just going to try this app out - won't load, absolutely nothing - just the logo & spinning wheel of death!"
18,Good
19,Horrible app. Chrashes every 5 minutes. It's a shame that all the good work done by the artists on Bert's roast is ruined by this app. Will wait for it to come on some other platform. Uninstalling right away.

40,Not even worth a review. Throw the whole app away. 😒
41,It's not even an app. It's just a blue page with OFTV and something white circling it. It's probably British intellience trying to disrupt entry or use of the app.

116,Shut yee ty
117,Not what expected
118,what was the goal here cause this is useless
119,This doesn't let you manage your own account it's just a thing for what they push to their version of the fyp. It's like a rebrand attempt to be one of those fake Dhar Mann apps but very disingenuous.
120,Still sussing it out
121,De fuquè is this? Do not install this god awful app.
122,Baaaad

124,Don't let me log in to GFs account

126,Yep can't use this as a version of the app to login to my account. Funny they don't have a proper mobile app for browsing content or anything so it's like not having a account despite having one.
127,Can't login
128,"App is terrible, can barely do anything on it and the website keeps declining my card for no reason, no problems on the bank end"

146,Couldn't sign in couldn't search or anything
147,Cant log into my account cant find any of my subscriptions what is the tomfoolery of a app?
148,I thought it was porn videos
149,Just downloaded and it can't find my friend the only creator I subscribed to so I have to use the web version
150,Excellent app service
151,Dogshit i hope the app creators are killed
152,No for creators
153,"Just an advertisement for the content OF promotes, not the content people came to OF for and made it successful. Only people giving this positive reviews are paid OF creators. You can't sign in and search for the people you follow, complete waste of time."
154,This will be the last end game 🎯
155,Trash
156,App is not easy to use and very confusing. Deleted it after 20 minutes.
157,Garbage you can't even log in
158,"Never downloaded it. This app should be called ""pay way too much for pr0n you can find in Google search."" Whytf all you simps buying all this bs? You can get anything paid on here on Reddit for free.... Smh"
159,Doesn't work.
160,neni su cicky 😔
161,Only fans is completely rubbish. I tried to sign up but the procedure took too long and didn't work in the end. Mainly due to the age verification. The current age verification procedure needs to be scrapped and made more simple and quick as it doesn't work. How can I use Only Fans if the sign up and AV doesn't work? The owner of Only Fans needs to be shot. What a complete idi.
162,downloading is a headache
163,Terrible
164,Cannot find a creator I can find on the web app.
165,"Doesn't work at all. Just stick to the browser, this all doesn't work at all"
166,Was very pleased with the download size... then altogether crestfallen when I couldn't sign in. Please fix ASAP!
167,Search engine doesn't work
168,@ bigdollyfun 😘
169,Lousy service. Claimed that I need the browser that I already have installed to see it. P
170,Not of just a weird show app
171,Pointless app
172,Horrible
173,"No log in, search doesn't work."
174,"The rating is heavily impacted by people looking for a different kind of content. Guess what? There is a clean, SFW content on OF, too! This app showcases amazing, free content of talented content providers that use the platform to raise funds. Technically, the app works like a charm, too. So forget about those one star reviews of disappointed adult content seekers and give it a try."
175,Waste of time
176,Very bad
177,"OFTV has a collection of video clips that discuss fitness, beauty, makeup, and culture. The participation is low, it is supposed to be the top models/creators from the website. Very unoriginal, unrelated to what the actual OF is known for, the target demographic of OFTV is young females, not the demographic (males, 20-80) that the actual OF already appeals to. Maybe the worst app of all time."
178,"Completely Pointless, you can't even log in to your own account."
179,Search is pretty worthless
180,Can't login.
181,"This app doesn't give an option to sign into my account so that I can view MY favorite creators, saves/bookmarks, subscriptions and everything???....Wouldn't that be half the point of an OF app?...What a waste of an otherwise well put together app."
182,Search won't work
183,Waste of time. Installed tried it and Uninstalled in 5min. No log in feature and search doesn't work. Absolutely pointless.
184,Don't want to unlock
185,"Can't sell the content I was expecting to... Change the name of the app, it's misleading"
186,App not working
187,"App is garbage, cant even search for creators"

191,Cant log in and search for specific people. Useless app
192,There is no login in.
193,this app would be great if you could use it. it's broken and I would redownload it if it gets fixed and the issues and feature updates get addressed
194,I like of not so much OFTV
195,So far so good I guess. Everything works fine
196,Terrible. Nothing works.
197,Bad app Like seriously
198,Decieving. Can't log into your account because it's a pg rated app only.
199,This app literally doesn't work
200,Informative marketable I thim

202,Has nothing to do with only fans. Absolutely nothing. Don't bother.
203,This is a bad app
204,Okay
205,Not worth it
206,Thus app sucks. It won't even open to the main page. It just spins like it's thinking. Waited like 5 minutes. Still nothing just a loading spinning sign.
207,Quickest uninstall ever... Only let's you search (their) selected profiles. Don't waste your time...
208,"I first thought that it was a fake app then I got here with the link provided on OF website. App doesn't work. Search thing doesn't work. Can't find friends or anything else. There's Tourism and GREAT cooking tips content ! But friends who are posting their own content are nowhere on it and it's impossible to find anything or everyone because SEARCH thing displays BLANK page, no matter what we put inside. Website is also bad done. Frame resizing and screen rotation lead to incoherent results."
209,Installed then uninstalled. No sign up. No login
210,The app and the websight are 2 different things. Can't find any of the xxx pages I follow
211,Can't see the content I want.

300,"It's just a white screen. No search, no login, just a white screen."
301,"You can't logg in, it's sucks,"
302,Not the Actual OnlyFans im after. No login and a completely different thing to what you would get on the website.
303,Violates North American laws and illegally collects data while not providing the service they falsely claim to provide. Lawyer contacted.
304,This app Is HORRIBLE AND Alows People the make fake accounts on others and potray them as Nasty people.
305,pls improve the app quality
306,It's meh
307,Love the app! It's like a YouTube for onlyfans. So easy to use and the content is really good. I also find it useful that if I like the creator it gives me the link for their onlyfans. Love it!
308,Love the app. It's not the OnlyFans app but it's a great place to see more streamlined content.
309,this app is completely fake. have to continue using my actual onlyfans account through google since for some reason there is no onlyfans app.
310,This is a scam. Not actually onlyfans. You can't do anything on it. Can't get paid or add anything. Do not install this app.
311,Scam
312,Bogus. Waste of time
313,"downloaded to watch the Baddies Atl..At first glance everything seems good i see ALL episodes available. I'm like cool but however i Was only able to watch 1 show, episode 2, after that you are not able to fast forward to continue. So I unistalled and re installed the app thinking this would fixed the problem and same thing happened. Only episode 2 is available but it gives you fast forward button and nothing else happens. Unfortunately I wasn't interested in seeing anything else..I deleted"
314,Thought this was the porn site app HAHAHAHA
315,Can't log in... pointless
316,"So little ""regular"" onlyfans content. Nothing here you couldn't just watch on YouTube. Uninstalled straight after searching for two creators that yielded ""no result"". Pointless app."
317,Good
318,Loving this app. And Model Farmers is inspired. Best content on here.
319,Useless
320,Not actual app
321,"No login, no settings."
322,Good.
323,You guys are b ridiculous. This isn't Only Fans. It's an app so only fans creators can make non sexual content.to do so you do it on tge only fans app. I perosnqlly downloaded bc i wnana watch baddies atl. The app is a lil hard to work with but u don't need to login to anything to watch which I like. I'm pretty neutral about the app I don't hate pr live it so imma give a 3

331,Why would you make this app so no one can log in what's the point
332,🔐🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🔐
333,incredible
334,Doesn't work! You can't even sign in! How are you supposed to get to your content if they don't know it's you? What a complete and utter disappointment. I hope the developer is good at something else because they really need a different job.
335,waste of time
336,"There is no login. Total waste of time. This isn't Onlyfans. It's videos on cooking, crafts, etc."
337,Does not do what you think it does
338,Very poor quality app you can only watch videos can't sign into your own account and as a creator have an easier time uploading and maintaining your subscribers chats.
339,You can't use it as a creator????
340,Very good
341,Can't find the porn
342,Great

357,Cannot create account. Stupid app.
358,This is for not sexuals. Not good.
359,Great

364,Fake app
365,Constantly crashing this app
366,Rubbish
367,Rated R for Relateable.
368,"Worthless, you can't upload from this app. Plus i can't find an OFFICIAL Android app that will let me. All i see are knock offs"
369,"Like a rubbish YouTube, worthless"
370,Waste of time
371,Trash
372,Yess finally some entertainment that I can Enjoy fy! Thanks 🫂😊 so much I will ✔️ you out on the flip side
373,Fake is app
374,I don't think the people on this liked the fact that I'm communist I even got unfolled on Instagram but hay look what America did to African people in its own country Alot of African Americans migrated to the soviet union during world War 2 and going back to when America had the slave trade
375,This just feels like YouTube or InstagramTV but worse
376,I like it but i don't like it
377,To be honest its really boring and very limited on content unless your just the nerdy type willing to watch this stuff to no end.
378,"Shady business, stay away!!"

380,Absolute garbage exploitative company
381,I would give it a 0 if I could.... Just straight garbage
382,You know why
383,Took away lifetime referrals and now banning the creators that made OF what it is today. oftv is terrible
384,"OnlyFans? Really? It's pretty basic and for most people, worthless value Now deleted"
385,"Awful, kept crashing, froze my phone, had to keep restarting. Had to delete it."
386,"constantly crashes, can never get past the loading screen, avoid for your own sanity"
387,Not worth it. You fired 50k workers for this? Just go on yt or ig or tiktok or master class.
388,Pointless without any nsfw content
389,"Not a OF creator or user but I figured I'd give it a try to see what it was like and it's pretty bad. Content is not great, experience is not great, video quality is not great. So it's an app that allows you to watch couple hundred not great videos, and offers nothing new. Definitely not something that require people to need a whole independent app to consume."
390,"OnlyFans Creators, Don't bother downloading this app since there is No way to make an account, or upload your own videos. Until they allow creators to upload here, you will just have to Subscribe on the Real OnlyFans site @AnonymousVixin to see these sexy fun videos 💋 Oftv is complete Trash. There is no organization and is complete chaos."
391,Total and complete garbage. Unusable. Deleted instantly.
392,How do I beat my meat to a cooking show

396,"can't make a user OR creator profile, you can't upload videos, the content on any given subject is like watching random jocks trying to report the news. I was excited to start my own channel as an OF creator myself (beneath_the_roses) really surprised to find out that's not an option. If this isn't available for us creators to use and make our own channels with, what's the point? The content is gabage if youre looking for actual fitness/music/cooking etc, which is their goal, just go to YouTube"
397,Hahahahahahaha
398,"I'm interested in this app as a creator, saw the news from Philip DeFranco and I look forward to making this another platform for my contact, we'll adjust the rating if it's not a good experience"
399,"No way, I already have youtube!"
