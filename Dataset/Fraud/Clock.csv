The floating clock on screen kept disappearing everytime the screen is locked. And it's even worse when you put a timer or stopwatch. It doesn't work. Didn't meet my expectations.
It's not working for me. It doesn't show clock on screen
Doesnt even work
Useless does work. Waste of time
Very bad

"It is a good app, but after I switch off my screen the clock is disappeared when I unlock my phone"

"None of the functions actually work except for the floating clocks. But you can't set any actual time on on. Furthermore, you are bombarded with ads."

Why is there a problem with floating timer apps seems like so many bad reviews all I want is a floating g timer app that works so what's the problem there should be no problems with these types of apps

"😂👍 First screen you see: ""Can we continue to collect your data to tailor ads to you?"" So you want to collect and quietly sell my data? NOPE! Bye."
Got blinded by Ads couldn't use it
Nice
Just installed it
Cant change celcius to fairenhiet
"DON'T BUY IT!!! Is version 1.20 some kind of fake? I purchased no-adv version, but still has adv in main screen and fullscreen trying to access options as clock, same as 1.19. Whats the point to buy a non-adv version? Don't try it, this app is a waste of time and maybe stealing info because location permission is not neccesary to run a simple clock."
Its not working
The best for me....
On screen too big and not resizable. Also fixed to hh:mm:ss:¹/100ss Couldn't turn it to only hh:mm
Shitbagz. Too much ad spam takeover phone. They just want money for simple timer
"This app is full of ads, I don't know if it is the app I downloaded or ads.. It's a waste.. Negative 5 star"
Saw how many ads and immediately uninstalled.
Startup time is uncomfortably slow and trigger me
Does everything I need it to and lasts a long time fantastic
Horrible
No seconds + advertisement fest
"Never download this app its a scam ,too many ads"
